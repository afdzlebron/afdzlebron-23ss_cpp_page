        Lesson 1 of 4
        &quot;The convergence of information, media, and technology has created the predominant ecosystem of our time. Since 2018, more than half of the world's population (over four billion people) are using the Internet. From cradle to grave, we are interconnected through a globally-networked media and consumer society.&quot; (Kellner &amp; Share, 2019)&quot;All knowledge is an interpretation.&quot; (Kincheloe, 2007)

        The Fabric of Critical Media Literacy
        
        New technologies, new literacies, new ways of learning
        
        Since the beginning of recorded history and the invention(s) of writing systems, the concept of “literacy” meant having the skill to interpret “squiggles” on a piece of paper as letters which, when put together, formed words that conveyed meaning. 
        
        Today, information about the world around us comes to us not only by words on a piece of paper but more and more through the powerful images and sounds of our multi-media culture. Radio, television, film, cell phones, popular music, the Internet, social networks, and other forms of media culture provide materials out of which "we forge our sense of selfhood; our notions of gender; our conceptions of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, and of sexuality. (Kellner/Share, 2019) 
        
        In today's complicated media environment, literacy skills that are limited to decoding, analyzing, and writing in print aren't enough to earn a student the full benefits of being literate. Neither is doing the same old things with high-tech solutions or automatically championing new technologies. Rather, like influential educational philosopher Paulo Freire, we think of literacy as the broad set of skills and habits that enable one to engage thoughtfully with the community and the world. Also, literacy comprises gaining competencies and awareness involved in effectively using socially-constructed forms of communication and representation. (Kellner & Share, 2019)

        In the following units, we will take a closer look at what it means to be literate in the Digital Age and how you can prepare yourself to thrive in the ever-shifting terrain of the digital world. We offer this course as a springboard for students and emerging educators who are ready to jump into the Critical Media Literacy pond. We think you will find, as we have, that the waters are invigorating.

        Concepts & definitions
        
        One consequence of the fact that every person interprets media through the lens of their own experience is that sometimes we think we have shared meaning even when we don't. 
        
        In the following unit, let's break down the main concepts in this course's title, hoping that in doing so, you will gain a common ground where to start from and eventually reach back to during your learning journey.

        What Do We Mean by...
        
        Media?
        
        From the moment we wake up until we go to sleep, media are part of our environment. They are so integrated into our lives that sometimes we don't pay conscious attention to the majority of media messages that we encounter. Since people can't think critically about things they don't notice, it seems to be a natural first step to gain awareness of the role media plays in our lives. 
        
        To explore this point, we need to be clear about what we mean by media. This term can have different meanings in different contexts (for example, in art it might refer to clay or paint.) In the context of Critical Media Literacy (hereafter abbreviated as CML), it refers to mass media. 
        
        There are three majors characteristics of mass media: 1) Media convey messages through visuals, language, and/or sound. 2) Media messages are mass-produced for a mass audience and are mediated by some form of technology. 3) Producers of media messages are not in the same physical space as the receiver(s) of those messages. 
        
        Types of mass media: Print, broadcast, online
        
            Old media 
                print: newspapers, magazines, books, billboard
                broadcast: radio, television, musical recordings, films
            New media
                the Internet: websites, blogs, vlogs, podcasts, streaming audio, streaming video, e-books, social networks

        [Task] Learning Journal: Reflection
        
        
        Take a minute to think about all the different kinds of media that you have used or been exposed to from the moment you woke up today until right now. 
        
            How does the list compare to the one we offered above?
            Did you include things like books, the logo on your shoes or coffee cup, the background music in the grocery store, or media other people used in your presence? Why? Why not? 
            Why does it matter if we are aware of the media in our lives or our environment? What are the potential consequences of being aware of some media messages but not others?

        What Do We Mean by...
        
        Media Literacy? 
        
        Over several decades, continents, and academic disciplines, a definition has emerged that characterizes media literacy as a set of capabilities applied to media messages and experiences. 
        What is Media Literacy?
        
        What is Media Literacy?
        
        Media literacy is a term that means many different things to different people— scholars, educators, citizen activists, and the general public. This article reviews the variety of definitions and presents a synthesis of commonalities that most definitions of media literacy share.

        Many of you will find familiar territory in media literacy because its goals overlap with other important literacies, such as digital literacy, information and communication technologies (ICT), or information literacy, each borrowing from the other, each sharing goals with media literacy.  Adding critical analysis to technical instruction is a distinguishing feature of media literacy. 
        
        While one may hold educating digital skills to digital natives for fairly redundant, research has shown that large amounts of computer, mobile and internet use only contribute to digital skills at the operational level. The higher-order cognitive ability for critical thinking, e.g. the search, analysis, selection and evaluation of information, is not a consequence of greater consumption. Therefore, increased consumption of technology as such should not be regarded as proof of digital competence. (Van Deursen, 2010; Skov, 2016)

        What Do We Mean by...
        
        Critical Media Literacy? 
        
        Media literacy skills are closely related to critical thinking skills, as they challenge us to think more deeply about not only what we see but what we know.
        
        The term "critical" is sometimes conflated with a negative judgement or an accusatory perspective. For some, the word "critical" may mean finding fault with or judging unfairly, complaining about something constantly, and imposing their personal opinions. But there is a useful distinction to be made between "critique that seeks to expand consciousness and harsh critique that attacks or trashes." (bell hooks, 2010). 
        
        As you sit back and tuck into this course, please bear in mind that t approach defines "critical" as an aspect of dialectical, sociocultural, and analytical process. 
        
        Rather than cynically dismissing entire media styles and practices, the critical approach attempts to understand the institutional and interpretive processes through which media are made distributed and interpreted.
        
        Campbell, Jensen, Gomery, Fabos, Frechette (2013)

        Campbell, Jensen, Gomery, Fabos, Frechette (2013)
        
        This attempt at understanding invokes critical thinking that is more than just a cognitive idea; it is also a sociocultural understanding that seeks to develop in students a social consciousness as well as a working knowledge of how media operates. 
        
        Let's focus on the five key components of critical thinking as a framework for this course's approach.

        CML takes these elements of critical thinking and applies them to the analysis and creation of media messages. In doing so, it establishes critical thinking skills as cornerstones for building higher-order thinking skills like synthesis, evaluation, and problem solving and turns those into lifelong habits. (Scheibe & Rogow, 2012)

        All acts of information through the media are acts of communication. Therefore, before we jump into the discussion about media, manipulation, and information disorder, it is crucial to understand how communication works. 
        Communication is not just the sharing of a message. Communication is an act of sharing, conveying, and exchange of ideas, knowledge, and information.  It is an act that takes place in a community and is transmitted through a medium. Communication is a social act that is supported by an infrastructure.

        The Nature of Media Messages: Key Concepts
        
        The research of Media Literacy embraces a set of core ideas about the nature of media messages. Though specific wording varies, there is a broad agreement on these six main points: 
        
            1
        
            1
        
            All media messages are constructed. By definition, media messages are representations, filtered through human decisions and the constraints and capabilities of media technologies. This fundamental concept serves to focus attention not just on the message itself, but also on who is behind it and the purposeful way in which it was made. 
            2
        
            2
        
            Each medium has different characteristics, strengths, and a "unique" language of construction. Every type of media has its own set of "grammatical" rules that makes it comprehensible to users. 
            3
        
            3
        
            Media messages are produced for particular purposes. People often have more than one reason for creating media messages, and many messages are created by teams of people, each with particular goals. 
            4
        
            4
        
            All media messages contain embedded values and points of view. In addition to the obvious, media messages reflect the experiences and assumptions of producers and audiences, as well as societal norms and media conventions. For example, while the overt content of a clothing ad is about selling the clothes (or a brand), the choice of a particular model -his body type, height, weight, hair-style and hair color, skin color, and age-also conveys implicit ideas and cultural preocuppations about beauty. 
            5
        
            5
        
            People use the individual skills, beliefs, and experiences to construct their ows meanings from media messages. Audiences are active participants in the communication process, and because every person is different, there is no such thing as an automatic interpretation that is true for everyone. There are often dominatn readings (i.e., interpretations on which most people would agree), and there can be inaccurate interpretations that are supported by evidence in the document, but is quite possible for two people to interpret the same media text differently without either of them being wrong. Common variables affecting interpretations of media messages include race, ethnicity, culture, gender, identity, socioeconomic class geography (e.g. rural/urban region), prior knowledge and political affiliation. 
            6
        
            6
        
            Media and media messages can influence beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, and the democratic process. We include the word can here because media influence is significant, but it is neither absolute nor automatic. Media messages can influence people, but they don't always. Nevertheless, media literacy education is build on the assumption that media matter.

        Why Media Literacy is Important
        
        Click on the + symbol on the right to learn more about the importance of being a media literate citizen:
        
        In a global media culture, people need three skills in order to be engaged citizens of a democracy: critical thinking, self-expression and participation. Media literacy instils these core skills, enabling future citizens to sort through political packaging, understand and contribute to public discourse, and, ultimately, make informed decisions in the voting booth.

        Introduction to Fake News and Information Disorder
        Lesson 2 of 4
        Bild1.png
        
        Rumours, conspiracy theories and fabricated content have already been around us for a while and they are well historically traced and documented. However, we are witnessing something new with the contemporary social technology means: 
        
            information pollution at a global scale; 
            a complex web of motivations for creating, disseminating and consuming these ‘polluted’ messages;
            a myriad of content types and techniques for amplifying content; 
            innumerable platforms hosting and reproducing this content; and 
            breakneck speeds of communication between trusted peers (C. Wardle & H. Derakhshan (2017).
        
        Digital Democracy and Citizenship
        
        The complexity and scale of information pollution in our digitally-connected world presents an unprecedented and worrisome challenge.
        
        The 21st century has given mankind both the greatest gift and the biggest challenge - Digital Citizenship. The Internet has managed to bring changes that the most ardent utopists would have found difficult to imagine - boundaries of time and space, which previously served as the foundation for all existing political, educational, economic and other systems necessary for management and regulations, have become conventional. 
        
        Today’s education policy and educational standards constantly call on educators to train not only knowledge-oriented future citizens, but future citizens who are equipped with the skills needed in the 21st century, future citizens who are able to correctly navigate in the traditional reality as well as in e-reality, guided by democratic values and attitudes.  
        
        It is also important to bear in mind that today the Internet is being turned into the field of political and ideological battles. While parties to any conflict are always tempted to present a one-sided interpretation, such presentations are not helpful for resolving any conflict. It is essential to promote dialogue, mutual understanding, compromise and peaceful conflict resolution. That’s why everyone must be well prepared to equip herself (and sometimes others) with skills to search and compare information on different perspectives, analyse one-sided representations and identify cases of the manipulative use of social media. Since today, any individual from any part of the world has access to any kind of information and can become an author and a messenger of any information, it is necessary to enable them to research, critically evaluate and analyse information, and to prevent discrimination, show respect for diversity, for the rights of others and to preserve their identity in the boundless world of the Internet.
        
        In the light of the facts mentioned above, the ability of a person to critically analyse and evaluate information has become a crucially important survival skill, and that is why it is referred to as, and ranked as, one of the basic skills of the 21st century (Council of Europe, 2015).

        The Council of Europe tackles the effects of digitized information on politics, public trust and democracy – and stresses the importance of sustained digital literacy to counter any negative effects. While digitization can promote transparency and increase public awareness of events, Europe’s premier human rights organisation – the Council of Europe – raises human rights concerns, including privacy rights, media freedom, and the damaging impact of information disorder on democracy (Council of Europe, 2017).
        This part of the course material is devoted to invite to think more critically about the language to be used, and to introduce some suggested terms, without definitional rigour, in order to effectively capture the complexity of the phenomenon.

        Journalists, commentators, policymakers, and scholars have a variety of words at their disposal — propaganda, dis-information, mis-information, and so on — to describe the accuracy and relevance of media content. These terms can carry a lot of baggage. They have each accrued different cultural associations and historical meanings, and they can take on different shades of meaning in different contexts. These differences may seem small, but they matter. The words we choose to describe media manipulation can lead to assumptions about how information spreads, who spreads it, and who receives it. These assumptions can shape what kinds of interventions or solutions seem desirable, appropriate, or even possible (p. 1).

        Have you ever wondered what makes news, news? 
        
        We look at the news values that determine which stories we see and hear about and which ones we do not and how those news values can subtly shape how we see the world. In a time of information overload, understanding the news has become more important than ever. 
        
        This video, which is a part of a series, helps you navigate the news, sort fact from fiction, and recognize how the media can shape one's world views. This video introduces you to the following topic, where definitions of constituent parts of information disorder, which goes beyond "fake news", are provided.

        Definition: Fake News
        
        In recent various sources, the term disinformation or information disorder is favoured over fake news. Below you will find quoted different authors, who believe that the term of fake news definition is both restrictive and misleading, and its controversies reflect a burgeoning crisis.

        Fake news is the promotion and propagation of news articles via social media. These articles are promoted in such a way that they appear to be spread by other users, as opposed to being paid-for advertising. The news stories distributed are designed to influence or manipulate users’ opinions on a certain topic towards certain objectives. (L. Gu, V. Kropotov, & F. Yarochkin (2017)
        
        bullet
        
        As Zuckerman (2017) states, “It’s a vague and ambiguous term that spans everything from false balance (actual news that doesn’t deserve our attention), propaganda (weaponized speech designed to support one party over another) and disinformatzya (information designed to sow doubt and increase mistrust in institutions).” 
        
            bullet
        
            David Mikkelson (2016) also warned not to lump everything into the “fake news” category. “The fictions and fabrications that comprise fake news are but a subset of the larger bad news phenomenon, which also encompasses many forms of shoddy, un-researched, error-filled, and deliberately misleading reporting that do a disservice to everyone,” he wrote. 
        
        In some sources, this term might be refrained from using, due to its woefully inadequacy to describe the complex phenomena of information pollution, which is begun to be appropriated by politicians around the world to describe news organizations whose coverage they find disagreeable and by which the powerful can clamp down upon, restrict, undermine and circumvent the free press. Therefore, the term “fake news” is unhelpful, however, there is no other globally accepted alternative. 
        
        Therefore, "information disorder" and other terms, closely related to the context, will be further used in this course. 
        
        How to Choose Your News
        
        In this part of the course, you will find another introductory video on how to choose your news in the vast variety of social media outlets available nowadays.
        
        With the advent of the Internet and social media, the news is distributed at an incredible rate by an unprecedented number of different media outlets. How do we choose which news to consume? Damon Brown gives the inside scoop on how the opinions and facts (and sometimes non-facts) make their way into the news and how the smart reader can tell them apart.

        In this sub-chapter, you will find other terms used in this training course to understand the further material better.
        
        Trolls provoke emotions by publicly offending their targets. Trolls are humans who post behind a username or handle. Yet, similar to bots, they can amplify dis-information in coordinated ways to evoke conformity among others. What they do better than bots is target those who question the veracity of a piece of information. Trolls work efficiently to silence naysayers in the early stages of dis-information distribution by posting personal attacks to undermine that person’s position on the board. 
        
        Challenges of filter bubbles and echo chambers 
        
        As Wired dramatically concluded in an article just after the US election in 2016, “[t]he global village that was once the internet has been replaced by digital islands of isolation that are drifting further apart each day. From your Facebook feed to your Google Search, as your experience online grows increasingly personalized, the internet’s islands grow farther apart.” (M. El-Bermawy, 2016). 
        
        There has also been research that challenges the ideas about the dangers of echo chambers. A survey of 14,000 people in seven countries that was published in May 2017 (W.H. Dutton et al., 2017) concluded that “people who are interested and involved in politics online are more likely to double-check questionable information they find on the internet and social media, including by searching online for additional sources in ways that will pop filter bubbles and break out of echo chambers.” (B. Dutton, 2017).
        
        In addition, the 2017 Digital News Report, published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, concluded, “Echo chambers and filter bubbles are undoubtedly real for some, but we also find that – on average – users of social media, aggregators and search engines experience more diversity than non-users.” (N. Newman, 2017).
        stock-image.jpg
        
        Concerns raised since Brexit and the US election have led to new innovations by social platforms, third-party organizations and academic institutions to help people ‘prick’ their filter bubbles. With the renewed emphasis on scaling news literacy programs globally, teaching how social algorithms produce these filter bubbles should be a crucial part of any standardized curriculum.
        
        We have to think about information consumption from a ritual as well as transmission perspective. If we recognize that people seek out and consume content for many reasons beyond simply becoming informed – like feeling connected to similar people or affiliating with a specific identify – it means that pricking the filter bubble requires more than simply providing diverse information.
        
        The listed challenges are suggested to be faced with new labels to identify different types of content on social platforms, systematic programs for taking down bot accounts, the integration of critical media literacy programs in schools and best practices for making fact-checks and debunks shareable.
        Information disorderWardle and Derakhshan (2017) introduce a new conceptual framework for examining information disorder, identifying the three different types: Mis - information;Dis - information; andMal - information.

        Claire Wardle (2017) outlines seven types of misinformation and disinformation, revealing the wide spectrum of problematic content online, from satire and parody (which, while a form of art, can become mis-information when audiences misinterpret the message) to full-blown fabricated content.

        Before going any further, we invite you to look at the summarizing quote of Caroline Jack (2017) of information disorder, which states that: 
        
        […] whether a given story or piece of content is labeled as misinformation or disinformation can depend as much on an actor’s intent as on the professional standards of the person evaluating it. Journalists and social scientists, for example, are cautious in making claims about an actor’s intent, because misrepresentations can lead to reputational damage, professional sanctions, and legal repercussions. If an actor’s intent appears ambiguous, or if there is no verifiable proof of intent to deceive, journalists and others may label something as misinformation rather than disinformation. Actors who intend to deceive their audiences may exploit these professionals’ cautiousness, relying on plausible deniability as a defense. This state of affairs creates an imbalance of power: actors who distribute deceptive or misleading content can do so without facing major threats to their own credibility, while posing potential legal and reputational threats to those who report on or critique them.

        Whom to trust to deliver reliable information?
        
        Social networks make it difficult for people to judge the credibility of any message because posts from reputable and reliable organisations and from conspiracy sites look nearly identical. The quantity of information published and shared daily is overwhelming, making it very difficult for an average news consumer to navigate the information ecosystem, and distinguish between genuine and fake news. Moreover, the most ‘successful’ of problematic content is that which plays on people’s emotions, encouraging feelings of superiority, anger or fear.
        
        The term fake news itself is also problematic for a number of reasons; “It’s a vague and ambiguous term that spans everything from false balance (actual news that doesn’t deserve our attention), propaganda (weaponized speech designed to support one party over another) and disinformatzya (information designed to sow doubt and increase mistrust in institutions).” (Zuckerman, 2017). Additionally, it is increasingly being used by politicians who wish to discredit news organisations they disagree with.

        Information Life-Cycle
        
        The life-cycle of a piece of information has three phases:
        
            Creation. The message is created.
            Production. The message is turned into a media product.
            Distribution. The message is distributed or made public.

        In trying to understand any example of information disorder, it is useful to consider it in three elements:
        
            Agent. Who were the ‘agents’ that created, produced and distributed the example, and what was their motivation?
            Message. What type of message was it? What format did it take? What were the characteristics?
            Interpreter. When the message was received by someone, how did they interpret the message? What action, if any, did they take?

        Agents are involved in all three phases of the information chain – creation, production and distribution – and have various motivations. Importantly, the characteristics of agents can vary from phase to phase. We suggest seven questions to ask about an agent:
        
            1
        
            1
        
            What type of actor are they? Agents can be official, like intelligence services, political parties, and news organizations. They can also be unofficial, like groups of citizens that have become evangelized about. In April 2017, Facebook published a paper by three members of its Security team, entitled “Information Operations and Facebook,” that outlines the use of the platform by state actors. They define information operations as “actions taken by organized actors (governments or non-state actors) to distort domestic or foreign political sentiment, most frequently to achieve a strategic and/or geopolitical outcome. These operations can use a combination of methods, such as false news, dis-information or networks of fake accounts aimed at manipulating public opinion (we refer to these as ‘false amplifiers’).” (J. Weedon, W. Nuland, & A. Stamos, 2017).
            2
        
            2
        
            How organized are they? Agents can work individually, in longstanding, tightly-organized organizations (e.g., PR firms or lobbying groups) or in impromptu groups organized around common interests.
            3
        
            3
        
            What are their motivations? There are four potential motivating factors: political, financial, social and psychological.

            4
        
            Which audiences to they intend to reach? Different agents might have different audiences in mind. These audiences can vary from an organization’s internal mailing lists or consumers, to social groups based on socioeconomic characteristics, to an entire society.
            5
        
            5
        
            Is the agent using automated technology? The ability to automate the creation and dissemination of messages online has become much easier and, crucially, cheaper. There is much discussion about how to define a bot. One popular definition from the Oxford Internet Institute is an account that posts more than 50 times a day, on average. Such accounts are often automated, but could conceivably be operated by people. Other accounts, known as cyborgs, are operated jointly by software and people. Therefore, looking at an account’s posting frequency can be more useful than a fixation on whether an account is fake or not.

            Do they intend to mislead? The agent may or may not intend to deliberately mislead the target audience.

            7
        
            Do they intend to harm? The agent may or may not intend deliberately to cause harm.
        
        Continued
        
        The Agent: Motivations
        
        Understanding the potential social and psychological motivations for creating dis-information is also worth exploring. For example, consider the motivation to simply cause trouble or entertain. There have always been small numbers of people trying to ‘hoax’ the news media. Some share mis-information as a joke, only to find that people take it seriously. 
        
        Examining the audiences of hyper-partisans sites, we can also see the influence of political tribalism and identity. These types of sites do not peddle 100% fabricated content, but they are very successful in using emotive (and some would argue misleading) headlines, images and captions – which are often all of an article that’s read on platforms like Facebook – to get their audiences to share their messages.
        Continued
        
        Further, you will find the four potential motivating factors for creating dis-information.
        
        bullet
        
        Financial: Profiting from information disorder through advertising. Some of those who produce or distribute dis-information may do so merely for financial gain, as in the case of PR firms and fabricated news outlets.  
        
        bullet
        
        Political: Discrediting a political candidate in an election and other attempts to influence public opinion. East StratCom Task Force explains that “the dis-information campaign is a non-military measure for achieving political goals. 
        
        bullet
        
        Social: Connecting with a certain group online or off; and
        
            bullet
        
            Psychological: Seeking prestige or reinforcement.

        The Message: Five questions to askMessages can be communicated by agents in person (via gossip, speeches, etc.), in text (newspaper articles or pamphlets) or in audio/visual material (images, videos, motion-graphics, edited audio-clip, memes, etc.). While much of the current discussion about ‘fake news’ has focused on fabricated text articles, mis- and dis-information often appears in visual formats. This is important, as technologies for automatically analyzing text are significantly different from those for analyzing still and moving imagery.

        We suggest five questions to ask about a message:
        
            1
        
            1
        
            How durable is the message? Some messages are designed to stay relevant and impactful for the long term (throughout an entire war or in perpetuity). Others are designed for the short term (during an election) or just one moment, as in the case of an individual message during a breaking news event.
            2
        
            2
        
            How accurate is the message? The accuracy of a message is also important to examine. As discussed earlier, mal-information is truthful information used to harm (either by moving private information into the public arena or using people’s affiliations, like their religion, against them). For inaccurate information, there is a scale of accuracy from false connection (a click-bait headline that is mismatched with its article’s content) to 100% fabricated information. You’ve done your best to prepare. Now, let go. There’s no one way your life should unfold. Enjoy the journey.
            3
        
            3
        
            Is the message legal? The message might be illegal, as in the cases of recognized hate speech, intellectual property violations, privacy infringements or harassment. Of course, what messages are legal differs by jurisdiction.
            4
        
            4
        
            Is the message ‘imposter content’, i.e. posing as an official source? The message may use official branding (e.g., logos) unofficially, or it may steal the name or image of an individual (e.g., a well-known journalist) in order to appear credible.
            5
        
            5
        
            What is the message’s intended target? The agent has an intended audience in mind (the audience they want to influence) but this is different to the target of the message (those who are being discredited). The target can be an individual (a candidate or a political or business leader), an organisation (a private firm or a government agency), a social group (a race, ethnicity, the elite, etc.) or an entire society.

        Digital technology is opening opportunities for individual participation and alternative points of view, while at the same time, a few enormous media and technology corporations have become the dominant chroniclers, narrators, and gatekeepers of information, often repeating the same story, at the expense of countless different perspectives and creative ways of thinking. Many of these storytellers are actually story-sellers, more interested in peddling ideas and products, than informing, enlightening, inspiring, or encouraging critical thinking. (Kellner, Share; 2019)

        The Appealing Message. Four Characteristics.
        
        Those who create information campaigns, true or false, understand the power of this formula. Identifying these characteristics helps us to recognize dis-information campaigns which are more likely to be successful, and to inform our attempts to counter dis-information.
        
        While much of the conversation about mis- and dis-information has focused on the role of the internet in propagating messages, we must not forget that information travels by word of mouth. The offline and online worlds are not separate, although the challenges researchers face in effectively studying the effects of different forms of communication simultaneously means it’s easier to think about these elements separately.
        
        The ‘fake news’ conversation has also focused on text-based, fabricated news websites. As Nausicaa Renner (2017) argues:
        
        the fake news conversation has taken place in the realm of words, but that’s missing a big part of the story. Much of the content that circulates on Facebook are images, often memes. They’re not attached to an article, and there’s often no way to trace their source. And while Facebook’s algorithm is notoriously elusive, it seems to favour images and video over text. As such, images have the potential to reach more readers than articles — whether fake, real, non-partisan or hyper-partisan.

        the fake news conversation has taken place in the realm of words, but that’s missing a big part of the story. Much of the content that circulates on Facebook are images, often memes. They’re not attached to an article, and there’s often no way to trace their source. And while Facebook’s algorithm is notoriously elusive, it seems to favour images and video over text. As such, images have the potential to reach more readers than articles — whether fake, real, non-partisan or hyper-partisan.
        
        Nausicaa Renner
        
        Technology that could identify manipulated or fabricated images lags behind technology for parsing and analyzing text. While Google’s Reverse Image Search engine (see also TinEye and Yandex) is a good starting point for identifying when images have circulated before, we still don’t have publicly available reverse-video search engines or OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools capable of reading the text on memes in a timely manner. We need more sophisticated, widely accessible tools to help identify problematic visual content. Over the next few years, we will certainly see the development of artificial intelligence technologies to create as well as identify dis-information. It is critical that the engineers who develop the new products, tools and platforms have been provided ethical training on the unintended consequences of the algorithms they write.
        
        The focus of the message
        
        While agents have particular audiences in mind when they create dis-information, the targeted subject of the message will be different. Dis-information often deliberately highlights differences and divisions, whether they be between supporters of different political parties, nationalities, races, ethnicities, religious groups, socio-economic classes or castes. As Greenhill (2017) argues, these types of messages enable discriminatory and inflammatory ideas to enter public discourse and to be treated as fact. Once embedded, such ideas can, in turn, be used to create scapegoats, normalize prejudices, harden us-versus-them mentalities and, in extreme cases, even catalyze and justify violence.
        
        Most discussion around dis-information in the US and European contexts has focused on political messages, which, while worrying from a democratic perspective, tend not to incite violence. However, in other parts of the world, dis-information directed toward people due to their religious, ethnic or racial identities has led to violence. A number of examples can be found in fact-checking and analysis reports referred to in the publication “Information Disorder” (2017).

        Critical media and digital literacies need to engage conflicts around class and inequality, gender, racial and sexual oppression, religious discrimination, and political bias to teach students to become more critical and discriminating readers of a variety of texts, from books, to broadcast media, to new digital media and social networking. Hence, literacies must be constantly evolving to embrace new technologies and forms of culture and communication and must be critical, teaching students to become discerning readers, interpreters, and producers of media texts and new types of social communication.

        The Interpreter. The Credibility of a MessageAudiences are very rarely passive recipients of information. An ‘audience’ is made up of many individuals, each of which interprets information according to his or her own socio-cultural status, political positions and personal experiences. The types of information we consume, and the ways in which we make sense of them, are significantly impacted by our self-identity and the ‘tribes’ we associate with. And, in a world where what we like, comment on and share is visible to our friends, family and colleagues, these 'social' and performative forces are more powerful than ever.
        
        The Interpreter. 
        
        The Credibility of a Message
        
        
        Audiences are very rarely passive recipients of information. An ‘audience’ is made up of many individuals, each of which interprets information according to his or her own socio-cultural status, political positions and personal experiences. The types of information we consume, and the ways in which we make sense of them, are significantly impacted by our self-identity and the ‘tribes’ we associate with. And, in a world where what we like, comment on and share is visible to our friends, family and colleagues, these 'social' and performative forces are more powerful than ever.
        
        Evidence suggests that fact-checks do tend to nudge individuals’ knowledge in the direction of the correct information, but it certainly doesn’t replace the mis- or dis-information entirely. This reality complicates our search for solutions to information disorder. What the ‘interpreter’ can do with a message highlights how the three elements of information disorder should be considered parts of a potential never-ending cycle. In an era of social media, where everyone is a potential publisher, the interpreter can become the next ‘agent,’ deciding how to share and frame the message for their own networks.
        
        The posts that we like or comment on and the articles, videos or podcast episodes we share are all public. Borrowing from Erving Goffman’s (1956) metaphor of life as theatre, invariably, when we use social media to share news, we become performers. Whatever we like or share is often visible to our network of friends, family and acquaintances, and it affects their perceptions of us. If social media is a stage, our behaviour is a performance and our circle of friends or followers are our audience. Goffman (1956) thinks our goal for this performance is to manage our audience’s perception of us. Therefore, we tend to like or share things on social media that our friends or followers would expect us to like or share - or, in other words, what we would normally like or share.
        
        D. Kahan (2011) argues that while it’s tempting to fixate on the ‘lazy brain’ theory – that humans rely heavily on mental shortcuts to compensate for the vast amount of information they encounter every day – humans are instead making decisions about what position is most appropriate to publicly support. He concludes: 
        
        “Work on motivated cognition and political conflict tends to focus more on the need for maintaining a valued identity, particularly as a member of a group… But the seeming inability of economic interests to explain who believes what on issues such as climate change, the HPV vaccine, economic policies that include tax cuts or social welfare spending and the like is in fact the motivation for examining the contribution that identity-protective forms of motivated cognition make.

        The challenge for the human brain today is how these influences work in the context of social networks that are bombarding us with information, pinging us repeatedly via the smartphones in our pockets. 
        
        As WikiMedia testified to the UK Parliament (2017), “Our minds have always been a battleground for various social forces, but the sheer number of agents and institutions vying for control of our thoughts and feelings today is so large that it is confusing and destabilizing for many.”
        
        Filippo Menczer’s (X. Qiu et al., 2017) most recent research highlights the challenges of our brains to make decisions about credibility when the streams of information are overwhelming. In other words, normal people are too distracted by a deluge of information to find the most accurate stories: “[t]here are a hundred more stories you’re not seeing that are much better than those five that you thought were good.” So, according to this research, irrespective of echo chambers and confirmation bias, people are not sharing verified stories in part because they never see them.

        Let's put on 
        
        the magic glasses 
        
        of critical thinking.
        
        According to research, published in 2012-2013 and conducted before the heavy use of social media that we take for granted today, people used a set of key heuristics, or mental shortcuts, when evaluating the credibility of a source or message:
        
            Reputation. Based on recognition and familiarity.
            Endorsement. Whether others find it credible.
            Consistency. Whether the message is echoed by multiple sites.
            Expectancy violation. Whether a website looks and behaves in the expected manner.
            Self-confirmation. Whether a message confirms one’s beliefs.
            Persuasive intent. The intent of the source in creating the message.
        
        Continued
        
        A very recent meta-analysis (M.S. Chan, C.R. Jones, K.H. Jamieson, & D. Albarracín, 2017) of the psychological efficacy of messages countering misinformation provides an excellent overview of the research literature pertaining to debunks and how they impact people’s perceptions of mis-information. The review of the literature underlined that the effects of a debunking effect were weaker when audiences generated reasons in support of the initial mis-information, supporting what we know about the power of confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. 
        
        People are not incentivised to click out of social media to view an article in its original form. As such, the cue of ‘expectancy violation’ (whether the site behaves as expected) and ‘consistency’ (whether the information is supported by multiple sites) are unlikely to be utilized.
        
        The repetition component is particularly problematic on social media due to people trying to manipulate the platforms through bots that automatically “like” or “share” stories or ‘click farms’. These techniques can create false sense of popularity about content, and, by tagging influential people like celebrities, politicians or even journalists, impact the news cycle. A disturbing recent report by Trend Micro (L. Gu, V. Kropotov, & F. Yarochkin, 2017) outlines the varied ways that influence is being bought, and the ways in which click farms are being used to boost hashtags, game online petitions, skew online comment and create fake accounts.
        
        Cues like ‘endorsement’ also become more salient on social media. Our ability to immediately see whether friends and family have liked, shared, commented or retweeted a piece of content becomes a powerful influence on our credibility judgments. Human beings are drawn to follow the masses, particularly when the mass is shown to include your closest friends and family. As Jonathan Stray explains, “messages received in greater volume and from more sources will be more persuasive. Quantity does indeed have a quality all its own… [R]eceiving a message via multiple modes and from multiple sources increases the message’s perceived credibility, especially if a disseminating source is one with which an audience member identifies.” (J. Stray, 2017).
        Continued
        
        Summing up, it shall be noted that we need to be much more precise about the definitions we use to describe the phenomenon of information disorder, if we are to begin understanding how and why it is created, the forms that it takes, and its impact. We also need to understand how characteristics change as information flows through the different phases, and how the person who interprets a particular message can become an agent in their own right as they go on to re-share that message with their own networks.

        In the first part of Module 2, you were introduced to the full conceptual framework - the phases and elements of Information Disorder, namely what is the life-cycle of the example of the information disorder and how the three elements - an agent, a message, and an interpreter take place in creation, production and distribution of it. 
        
        This information will be used in the second part of this module, focusing mainly to guide you through the steps to be taken to spot fake news and information disorder in general in social media and around you. Some of the steps will be supported by educational videos. 
        In this part of the course material, we invite you to bounce back for about three minutes and watch Professor Sander van der Linden, Director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab at the University of Cambridge, as he provides his own personal introduction on how to identify fake news.

        Consider the source
        
        In order to avoid using fake, misleading, dis-information or propaganda sources, you can check it through the online created resources. If a claim or story cannot be verified by a fact-checking site, it shall not be believed or used and the site shall be ignored or even debunked.
        
        In this unit, you can find a list list of the most popular fact-checking resources to be used whenever there is doubt on the veracity of the claimed fact or a story.
        
        It shall also be worth noting that there is an ongoing debate on Source-Checking v. Fact-Checking. Increasingly, when assessing the credibility of a piece of information, the source who originally created the content or first shared it, can provide the strongest evidence about whether something is accurate. Newsrooms, and people relying on social media for information, need to be investigating the source, almost before they look at the content itself. Newsrooms in particular need more powerful tools to be able to visually map online networks and connections to understand how dis-information is being created, spread and amplified.

            Check the author. Another tell-tale sign of a fake story is often the byline. Who is the author? Does the byline exist at all? Check whether the name of the author is real. If any of the prizes are claimed to credit the author and/or the resource – that also can be easily checked.
        
            Check the date. You’ve done your best to prepare. Now, let go. There’s no one way your life should unfold. Enjoy the journey.
        
            What’s the support? Many times these bogus stories will cite official - or official-sounding - sources, but once you look into it, the source does not back up the claim. It can be either a piece of legislation or official statistical data, which is usually easily and publicly available.

        Incentives 
        
        In general, there could be a plethora of reasons why particular people, organisations, or states, pursue various disinformation activities. According to Klingova 2018, the spread of disinformation narratives depends on whether it is state-sponsored disinformation or it's urged by non-state actors. This has implications for both goals and means of information manipulation. (Though, state-actors can hire non-state actors as trolls or bots.)
        
        There are different types of incentives behind information manipulation: 
        
        GEOPOLITICAL
        
            the creation of a sphere of influence, 
            projection of power, 
            the establishment of a higher political presence in a particular region, 
            swaying the political orientation of another country, 
            de-legitimization or corrosion of state institutions etc.

            domestic conflict,
            discretization of a particular politician or party,
            the spread of particular point of views or narratives,
            sow doubts,
            influence public debate or perceptions etc. 
        
        IDEOLOGICAL 
        
            spread of particular ideology or dogma,
            indoctrination, recruitment, self-presentation (right-wing and Islamic extremists as actors of manipulation)

            use of clickbait,
            about 60% of the money from ads goes to website owners
        
        Example: 
        
        "Within Veles itself, the young entrepreneurs behind these websites became subjects of tantalizing intrigue. Between August and November, Boris earned nearly $16,000 off his two pro-Trump websites. The average monthly salary in Macedonia is $371."

        Can propaganda and dis-information solicit real-world impact? What are these consequences? Which emotions are exploited to make disinformation more effective?

        Let's go first trough some examples that show the real-world consequences that disinformatiion has on our lives.

        The Pizzagate 
        
        Many of you will have heard about it: The "Pizzagate". It is a debunked conspiracy theory that went viral during the 2016 United States presidential election. 
        
        In March 2016, the personal email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, was hacked in a spear-phishing attack. WikiLeaks published his emails in November 2016. Proponents of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory falsely claimed the emails contained coded messages that connected several high-ranking Democratic Party officials and U.S. restaurants with an alleged human trafficking and child sex ring. One of the establishments allegedly involved was the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C. 
        
        The theory has been extensively discredited by a wide range of organizations, including the Washington, D.C. police.
        
        Sadly enough, that's not the end of the story. A man attacked a popular Whashington Pizzeria and fired shots from a gun, wrongly believing he was saving childrenfrom sex slaves. Read more here.
        
        This example represents a powerful memento of the impact that fake stories and conspiracy theories may have in the real-world. 
        stock-image.jpg
        
        If a majority believes in something that is factually incorrect, the misinformation may form the basis for political and societal decisions that run counter to a society's best interest. (Marió Nicolini, founder of the Euro-Atlantic Center)
        
        Take a minute and think about other examples in history and present times when disinformation and conspiracy theories had or could have a negative impact on society and individuals.
        
        Exploiting emotions to trigger actions. In a world, where social networks increasingly replace news channels, we can witness the brutal impact of fake stories, disinformation and propaganda even more. What they have in common is that they play on the emotions of fear, superiority, responsibility, and empathy. Emotions can make people act easier than rational arguments do. Emotions have real power.
