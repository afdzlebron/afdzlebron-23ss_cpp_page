        An e-learning course developed by the FOSTERplus team &amp; brought to you by an Open Science Advocate

        MODULE 01: What is Open Science?
        What is Open Science?

        This introductory course will help you to understand what open science is and why it is something you should care about.
        Overview

        This introductory course will help you to understand what open science is and why it is something you should care about. You'll get to grips with the expectations of research funders and will learn how practising aspects of open science can benefit your career progression. Upon completing this course, you will:

            understand what Open Science means and why you should care about it
            be aware of some of the different ways to go about making your own research more open over the research lifecycle
            understand why funding bodies are in support of Open Science and what their basic requirements are 
            be aware of the potential benefits of practicing open science 

        It is important to remember that Open Science is not different to traditional science. It just means that you carry out your research in a more transparent and collaborative way. Open Science applies to all research disciplines. While Open Science is the most commonly used term, you may also hear people talking about Open Scholarship or Open Research in the Arts and Humanities.

        What is driving funding bodies to embrace Open Science?

        Many funders around the globe now require researchers to share outputs arising from the research they fund with as few restrictions as possible. The key driver for this is the belief that publicly funded research should be made available to support public trust in research, to support scrutiny and validation, to enable reuse, and to drive innovation.  

        What do funding bodies expect?

        As a general rule of thumb, most funders expect researchers to provide access to any publications arising from the research they fund as well as making the underlying data and software required to support the validation of these published findings accessible.

        Bear in mind that this does not necessarily mean that these data need to be made open. If there are good reasons to restrict access - for instance, to protect sensitive personal data - these should be clearly stated in the metadata description. Check out our courses on data protection and ethics and managing and sharing data for information on responsible data sharing.

        In recognition that realising impact from research takes time, many funders now also expect you to ensure that selected outputs remain accessible for between 5-10 years after your projects ends.

        MODULE 02: Best Practice in Open Research:


        This course introduces some practical steps for opening up your research practices and how to meet  expectations relating to openness from funders, publishers and peers. 
        Introduction

        This course introduces some practical steps toward making your research more open. We begin by exploring the practical implications of open research, and the benefits it can deliver for research integrity and public trust, as well as benefits you will accrue in your own work. After a short elaboration of some useful rules of thumb, we move quickly onto some more practical steps towards meeting contemporary best practice in open research, and introduce some useful discipline specific resources. Upon completing this course, you will:

            be able to contextualise you research environment
            be aware of the questions you should bear in mind as you progress through the key stages of your research 
            know about some discipline-specific resources to help you embed Open Science into work research practices

        International and multi-partner projects

        The importance of understanding context grows with larger, multi-partner, international and interdisciplinary projects, as what’s considered business-as-usual in one academic field (or country) may seem strange to an outsider. Communication, and recording decisions, is vital.

        Data Management Planning policies

        Data management planning policies are less firmly established than Open Access, but most major funders either require or recommend that data management plans (DMPs) be produced and maintained for funded research projects. This video produced by the University of Utrecht provides an excellent overview of how funding body policies - in this case the European Commission and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) - should influence your research practice from the earliest stages of the lifecycle. The video also provides some useful tips on who to contact at your own institution for support.

        Things to think about when you start your next research project
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        You'll begin thinking about the likely or desired outputs of your research at the proposal stage. At this stage, decide what can be openly shared and what needs to be restricted (for ethical or commercial reasons). You'll also need to think about what might have long-term value and what will only have short-term interest or usefulness. It’s relatively straightforward at this stage to add openness to the list of potential output attributes, together with things like commercial potential and societal impact.

        It’s a good idea to get advice on suitable tools and infrastructure that you can use to capture, analyse, access, and share and access your research outputs over the life of your project. It can be tempting to create bespoke approaches for your project but this generally tends to hinder the longer-term reuse potential. There is a wealth of European and disciplinary research infrastructure available so don’t reinvent the wheel! If in doubt about what you can use, ask for some advice from your institutional research support team or from colleagues in your discipline. 

        

        It’s also a good idea to think about potential publishing routes from an early stage, and to check that the publisher's policies on Open Access are compatible with your funding body and/or institutional rules. Similarly, it makes sense to identify potential long-term data archives where your data can be made accessible for the longer-term. Many data archives and repositories maintain lists of preferred file formats and metadata standards which are recommended for providing longer-term accessibility. If you plan to deposit in such an archive, it is a good idea to make sure that the formats you work with are compatible with what they will accept. Get in touch with the data archive if you have any concerns about whether they can support the formats you are working with.

        Once you've made key decisions about how the research should be carried out, make sure that your partners know about them! Communication is vital, especially in larger and more complex projects. Establish a planning and communications strategy, and make sure your plans (whether for Open Access, data management, or software and workflows) are clearly stated, kept up to date, read and understood!

        The FAIR principles which some high-profile funders have adopted as a framework for managing and sharing research data means your data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. You should consider the FAIR principles as you develop your data management plan.

        Whether your project involves capturing or creating data, or you are re-using existing datasets discovered via a dedicated archive, you’ll need to be sure that you’re handling and processing them responsibly.

        Transferring data from one place to another can also be tricky, particularly if it crosses national or European boundaries, so thinking these things through in advance can prevent risk and uncertainty.

        If you are dealing with sensitive data, you’ll want to make sure that security and access management approaches are in place.

        If you are dealing with commercially or ethically sensitive information, this will be mandatory and governed either by contracts or by law.

        Remember that access management and security are not just for others - they may also benefit you. This is particularly true if you plan to publish your own findings based on your research before opening it up to a wider audience during any agreed embargo period.

        Coming to the end of your research project? Here are a few things to consider.
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        When the research is nearing its conclusion, several things need to be done to ensure the outputs created remain useful for the long term. In an ideal world, and barring any sensitivities, data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). By adopting file and metadata standards - as well as common vocabularies, if these exist in your area - you should have laid the groundwork for this at the outset of your research.

        The last thing to do is to deposit your publications in a repository, ideally in a disciplinary data archive provided a suitable one exists. If not, check to see if your institution has its own repository. If neither of these options are available to you, you could make use of a generalist repository for your data such as Zenodo or Figshare which serve disciplines without a recognised or trusted long-term data archive.

        If your project involves software or workflows then you should archive a final, stable version somewhere like GitHub. And for both data and software/workflows, user-friendly readme files should be deposited alongside other contextual metadata, to make it easier for future reusers – and that includes yourself in a few years’ time! – to understand what you did at the time, and why.

        Attaching a license or a waiver to your research outputs is the simplest way of letting others know what rights they have to reuse your work, and which of your own rights (if any) you have chosen to assert. Creative Commons are the best-known open licenses, and if you don’t wish to assert any rights you can place your work in the public domain by attaching a rights waiver… but you’ll probably want to check with your funder and institution/research partners before doing this!

        The last step will be to assign persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to everything you deposit and link them together: publications, data, software, even people (e.g., ORCID), to ensure that the scholarly record endures into the future, and that the relationships between data, code and publications are recorded. Often this will be done automatically by the repository or archive.

        Funders increasingly expect to see data access statements in papers based on the research they fund, which – provided they use persistent identifiers as recommended – serve as a sustained link between the research conclusions and the evidence from which these findings were derived. Some funders also expect the use of specific repositories to store and provide access to research outputs over time so make sure you know what they expect and that you have complied.  

        Some high-profile funders have adopted the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles as a framework for managing and sharing research data. If your funder expects your data to be FAIR, make sure to check the FAIRness of your outputs as you move towards the end of your project.

        MODULE 03: Managing and Sharing Research Data: 


        In this course you will learn about managing and sharing findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data.
        Introduction

        Data-driven research is becoming increasingly common in a wide range of academic disciplines, from Archaeology to Zoology, and spanning Arts and Science subject areas alike. To support good research, we need to ensure that researchers have access to good data. Upon completing this course, you will:

            understand which data you can make open and which need to be protected
            know how to go about writing a data management plan
            understand the FAIR principles
            be able to select which data to keep and find an appropriate repository for them
            learn tips on how to get maximum impact from your research data

        What are research data?

        The University of Leeds describes research data as 'any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings'. Research data can include things like...
        ...raw data

        Raw data are those which are captured from instruments and sensors such as telescopes, smart phones, and satellites. 
        Raw data
        Visualisations
        Digital images, audio and video files
        Data can be anything and everything!
        What are research data? Complete
        Open, closed and shared data
        Open vs closed

        Ideally, all research data that can be shared should be made open. However, there are often good reasons for not sharing data. This short video produced by the Open Data Institute (ODI) helps to explain the different levels of openness that can be applied to data and explains why some data needs to be protected.

        Open vs closed Complete
        What is Open Data?

        The Open Data Institute (ODI) defines Open Data as those that anyone can access, use and share.  According to the ODI, open data must be licensed to make clear that anyone can use the data in any way they want, including transforming, combining, and sharing it with others, even for commercial purposes.

        The ODI provides a great introduction to all aspects of Open Data in their Open Data Essentials course. We highly recommend reviewing these modules.

        5-Star Open Data Model

        As seen in the 5-Star Open Data model by Tim Berners-Lee, if you want to embrace the open data approach, it involves more than just making data available online. Rather than just thinking about access, think about providing intelligent access.

        So, who decides whether your research data should be open, closed, or somewhere in between?

        Researchers have a key role to play in deciding what data can be shared but it is important to note that they are not the only stakeholders involved in making this decision.  

        If your research will involve working with human subjects, you will need to ensure that you obtain informed consent. Informed consent should let research participants know about any plans you have for sharing their data (i.e., within your research team or more widely) as well as any plans you have relating to the longer-term retention of their data to support reuse.

        Speak to your Ethics Team and make sure that any plans for reuse are built into consent forms you will use. If you plan to make use of a standard consent form available from your institution, be sure to read it through first to make sure it does not contain any blanket statements about not sharing data or promises to destroy the data at the end of the project.  

        Be sure to consider any data cleaning and/or anonymisation procedures that will need to be carried out to facilitate sharing early on. Bear in mind that these actions can be very costly so be sure to request sufficient budget for these activities in your grant proposals. 

        For more information on obtaining informed consent, please see our course on Data Protection and Ethics from the main list of courses. 

        If you are involved in a collaborative research project - either with other academic institutions, industry partners, or citizen science - you will need to make sure that your partners agree to data sharing. This should be clarified during the idea stage of your project and built into any consortium agreements that are developed to govern your project. Your Grants or Contracts Team should be able to help you. Bear in mind that your partners may only agree to sharing particular datasets and request that others are kept confidential.  It is a good idea to make any such restrictions clear in your research proposal. You should also agree at which point during the life of the project the selected datasets will be shared and with whom, and document these decisions so that all partners have a clear idea of what will happen and when. 

        As you are planning your research, consider which research data infrastructure you will use to make the data accessible and who will need access. It can be tempting to make use of Google docs or Drobox to easily share data with collaborators during the active stage of the project. However, be sure to consider whether you will be working with any personally or commercially sensitive data. If so, these are not the best options for secure data sharing. It is always a good idea to spend some time with your Information Services Team to find out what data sharing infrastructure they can support in-house. In most cases, managed infrastructure provided by your institution will provide better security and back-up and can often be made accessible to collaborators from other institutions. Be sure to discuss the scale and format(s) of the data you anticipate sharing and also consider how frequently access will be required (daily, monthly, annually). These aspects will inform the best storage and sharing options for your data during the life of your project and beyond.

        When selecting a repository for those data selected for longer-term retention and sharing, be sure to check that the repository meets your needs. For instance, if your data will only be shared with a specific research community you will need to ensure that the repository can provide a means of allowing researchers to request access and to be authenticated.

        Most data repositories have policies outlining any limits relating to the size of data deposit or restrictions on formats they will accept. Be aware of any normalisation processes that are undertaken by the repository (i.e., when deposited data are migrated to preferred formats). In many cases, normalisation can affect the usability of the data. For example, if an Excel spreadsheet that was presented in a publication is saved as a PDF, it will be available as a record of what was presented in the article but will lose much of the functionality needed to support validation and reuse. For instance, any formulas applied to individual cells within the spreadsheet will be lost. It will also mean that reuse of the data is more difficult and would require re-keying the data into a new spreadsheet. 

        If you have concerns that your data will be misused and this is putting you off sharing, bear in mind that you can still make the data accessible while requesting that potential reusers accept general terms and conditions regarding fair use. For example, you may request that researchers wishing to reuse the data tick a box indicating that they will not attempt to identify anonymised participants. The UK Data Service End User License (EUL) provides an example of how this approach is put into practice for a national data archive. 
        So, who decides whether your research data should be open, closed, or somewhere in between? Complete
        Data Management Planning

        Deciding which data should be open, closed or shared requires advanced planning. In this section, you'll learn how developing a data management plan can help you to make important decisions before your research begins. 
        What are data management plans (DMPs)?

        A data management plan (DMP) is a short document (normally 1-2 pages in length) that describes the scale and the format(s) of those data you will generate, collect or reuse during the life of your project and outlines how they will be handled and shared during your project and in the longer-term. Many funding bodies require a DMP to be submitted as part of new grant applications but even if your research isn’t supported by external funds, developing a DMP is a useful exercise whenever you’re working with data.

        Why bother writing a DMP?

        Some researchers are a bit sceptical about the value of writing a data management plan and feel it is just another administrative burden. There are lots of good reasons for writing a data management plan. Here are just a few of them. 
        To support research integrity

        Data management planning helps:

            avoid accusations of fraud or bad science as you can produce evidence for findings and enable validation
            support good research practice
            meet funding body requirements

        Data management planning tools - DMPonline

        DMPonline is a freely available tool that helps research teams to write data management plans that meet funding body requirements. DMPonline was jointly developed by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and the University of California Curation Center (UC3). The tool contains a number of templates that represent the requirements of different funding bodies across Europe. Users are asked three questions at the outset to determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) template when applying for an ESRC grant). Using tools like DMPonline takes the guesswork out of writing your data management plan by providing you with the specific set of questions that individual funding bodies want you to answer. The tool also provides users with general guidance - and where provided, institutional guidance - to make sure that your answers are realistic and implementable.

        For more information on data management plans and tips on writing them, check out the DCC website.

        What do funding bodies expect with regards to data management planning and sharing?

        Most funders expect that any data required to validate published findings will be made accessible, where possible, and that sensitive data will be adequately safeguarded. With regards to data management plans (DMPs), most funders simply want evidence at the grant application stage that data handling and sharing have been sufficiently considered before any research starts. Many funding bodies now require this evidence via the submission of a DMP at the grant application stage. It is important to stress that funders aren’t expecting something carved in stone. They expect that your DMP will be updated as the project progresses. You just need to be able to provide evidence that you have thought about the data you will be generating and how they will be managed and shared responsibly.
        H2020 Open Research Data Pilot

        As part of Horizon 2020 (H2020), the European Commission has introduced the Open Research Data Pilot (ORD) which aims to make research data generated by Horizon 2020 projects accessible with as few restrictions as possible while also ensuring that sensitive data are protected. The OpenAire project provides an excellent overview of the ORD Pilot.

        Open Research Data Pilot and data management plans

        Those opting into the ORD pilot are required to deliver a data management plan within the first six months of their project. As part of making research data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR), a DMP should include information on:

            the handling of research data during and after the end of the project  
            what data will be collected, processed and/or generated
            which methodology and standards will be applied
            whether data will be shared/made open access and
            how data will be curated and preserved (both during and beyond the life of the project)

        Please see the EC Guidelines on FAIR Data Management in Horizon 2020, Version 3.0 26 July 2016 for more information. The OpenAire project also provides step-by-step advice on how to write a data management plan.

        Making data FAIR
        FAIR Principles

        As noted above, many funders now endorse the FORCE11 FAIR principles which were published in 2016. The FAIR principles mean that data is:  

        Findable: the first step in making your data reusable is ensuring that they can be found by both humans and machines.

        Accessible: once someone has found your data, they need to know how they can get access to them. This could include going through an authorisation and/or authentication process.

        Interoperable: to make your data reusable, you should ensure that they can be integrated with other data and that they can be utilised by applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

        Reusable: to maximise the potential reuse of your data, make sure that they - and their related metadata - are well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

        The list above was distilled from the GO-FAIR initiative which provides excellent coverage of each of the FAIR principles in detail.

        When and how should you share your data?
        When should you share your data?

        Ideally, you should share your research data as soon as possible. This may be upon publication of research findings but could also be done much sooner in the research lifecycle. Many researchers are reluctant to share their data because they fear it isn’t perfect. While good quality data is definitely something we should all be striving to produce, the reality is that most data have slight quirks and anomalies. You don’t need to wait until your data is perfect to share it. It can still be very useful to others. In addition, sharing your data early can help to highlight any mistakes or inconsistencies that should be addressed prior to publishing your findings.

        Ways to share your data

        There are a number of ways you can share your data. Here are just a few options you can consider. 
        Subject specific repositories

        It is always a best to deposit your research data with a subject specific repository that is recognised in your field. Most of these will offer some added value in terms of providing quality control or additional context to support future reuse.

        Many journals and funders specify which data repositories they want researchers to use so it is a good idea to check the terms of your grant or publishing agreement for details. FAIRsharing, a service developed by the Oxford e-Research Centre offers a curated list of subject specific repositories that have been recommended or mandated by funding bodies and publishers.

        What data should you keep?
        Data selection

        It is important to stress that you do not need to preserve access to all data generated over the life of your project. The guidance from most funding bodies is that any data required to validate published findings should be retained beyond the life of the project. You may have other data that you feel is valuable beyond the life of your project. These data may be useful to you or to others. Your Library and/or Research Support Team can help you but ultimately selecting what data needs to be kept for validation purposes and those that might simply have longer term value are judgements that only you and other researchers involved in the project can make. The DCC offers a useful guide to help you decide which data to keep. In recognition that realising impact from research takes time, many funders expect you to ensure that the data selected for retention are kept for between 5-10 years after your project ends.

        Tips for getting the best impact from sharing your research data

        Here are a few ideas to help you get the biggest bang for your buck when sharing your research data. 
        Assign a DOI to your data

        Assign a unique and persistent identifier such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to your data. DOIs are alphanumeric strings that are tied to the digital location of your object and the related metadata description. To learn more about assigning DOIs, please see the DataCite website. Most data repositories will issue a DOI for your deposited datasets. By having a DOI, your data is easier to find and cite - and for you to get credit!

        MODULE 04: Open Source Software (OSS) and Workflows:


        This course introduces Open Source Software (OSS) and workflow management as an emerging but critical component of Open Science. 
        Introduction

        This course introduces Open Source Software (OSS) management and workflow as an emerging but critical component of Open Science. The course explains the role of software sharing and sustainability in reproducibility, trust and longevity, and provides different perspectives around the sharing and reuse of computational code and methods, namely the software producer, the software reuser, and the non-coder with an interest either in reproducing research findings or in following experimental processes. You'll learn about useful resources and tools for sharing and exposing your code and workflows. Upon completing this course, you will:

            understand the roles that open source software and open workflows play in supporting Open Science
            know how Open Science can support reproducibility
            be aware of issues to consider at different stages of the research lifecycle
            know about useful tools and resources to help you get started with using OSS and open workflows

        What does Open Source mean?

        According to Wikipedia, open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software. The Open Source Initiative explains that the license must allow users to make modifications and derived works, and must allow derived works to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software. This video produced by Socialsquare helps you to get to grips with the concept of Open Source (in LEGO!).

        Software code presents a series of instructions which tell a computer to perform one or more tasks, or define an object. Code can either be self-contained or modular, e.g. methods which contribute to a bigger task.

        A very simple program, and often the first task carried out when learning a new programming language, is the "Hello World" task. In BASIC this would be:

            10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"

            20 GOTO 10

            RUN

        This simply prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the screen over and over until a user presses 'Escape' (or whatever has been selected to stop the program) or the computer melts.

        Software code is most commonly shared via an online versioning repository, such as GitHub, Bitbucket or SourceForge. These allow older versions of software to be maintained and preserved in order to protect the robustness of the scientific record, as well as enabling future work to "fork" code so that it can be put to new uses. 

        In order to truly replicate results, especially from older studies, it is often necessary to recreate the original computing environment. Emulation and virtualisation tools such as Docker can help with this. 

        A scientific workflow is a repeatable series of steps which transforms information or processes data or other information in some way. These may be straightforward and linear or can be complex, involving logical operations to decide upon subsequent steps depending on input. Workflows are essential for supporting the validation of published findings.

        An example of a simple workflow could be:

        Title: "Making Toast v1.0"

            1. Put bread in toaster

            2. Turn on toaster

            3. Wait until bread is sufficiently toasted

            4. Carefully remove toast and put on a plate

        Of course, this assumes that there is bread in the house. It could be improved with steps explaining what to do if there is no bread (e.g. get money, go to shop, buy bread, return home), and ideally this would be archived as another version of the same workflow ("Making Toast v2.0") with metadata explaining the changes between v1.0 and v2.0. 

        Taverna (now officially Apache Taverna) is perhaps the best-known and most widely-used scientific workflow management system. It enables less technically proficient researchers to construct, share and maintain powerful, reproducible scientific workflows.

        Finally, it's worth noting that there's a difference between reproducibility and replicability. One is stronger than the other:

            A study is reproducible if there is a specific set of computational functions/analyses (usually specified in terms of code) that exactly reproduce all of the numbers in a published paper from raw data. It is now recognized that a critical component of the scientific process is that data analyses can be reproduced. This point has been driven home particularly for personalized medicine applications, where irreproducible results can lead to delays in evaluating new procedures that affect patients’ health. 

            But just because a study is reproducible does not mean that it is replicable. Replicability is stronger than reproducibility. A study is only replicable if you perform the exact same experiment (at least) twice, collect data in the same way both times, perform the same data analysis, and arrive at the same conclusions. The difference with reproducibility is that to achieve replicability, you have to perform the experiment and collect the data again. This of course introduces all sorts of new potential sources of error in your experiment (new scientists, new materials, new lab, new thinking, different settings on the machines, etc.)

        Sharing and preserving code and workflows serves both of these goals.

        Shared standards in coding

        If you are working in an area where reproducibility is relevant, preserving and enabling access to code and workflows is increasingly vital for the credibility of the research. Long-term or career software developers will almost certainly be aware of the benefits of using a versioning repository, and the software lifecycle (Develop &gt; Share &gt; Preserve); however many researchers are self-taught programmers, and less familiar with best practice and the necessity of readable documentation for future re-use. The Software Sustainability Institute and Software Preservation Network are two organisations seeking to raise standards in research programming, and provide useful resources to help you on your way.

        It’s good idea to create a software management plan, and keep this updated throughout the project lifecycle. Some details may not be known until later, but considering issues such as formats, licenses and persistent identifiers from an early stage may be worthwhile in any case.

        If you’re working with others, you should agree and adopt shared (and good, i.e. what other people do and expect you to do!) coding and workflow management practices, accompanying code and workflows with useful documentation, rich metadata and inline comments.

        The UK’s Software Sustainability Institute recommends the production of Software Management Plans, and provides useful guidance on how to do this.
        Software Sustainability Institute

        A common first step is to set up a versioning repository for software co-development and publication. Ideally this will be indexed and searchable, in order to help live up to the FAIR principles (i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). The FAIR principles were originally created for data, but also apply well to code.

        At regular milestones, it’s a good idea to archive major versions so that each has its own persistent identifier such as a DOI. This supports reproducibility by maintaining access and reference to older versions of software, so that experiments can be re-run as they were at the time, but the software itself can continue to develop.

        The same principles apply to workflows, with versioning and archiving of major changes carried out as standard.

        Towards the end of the project, you’ll want to deposit code/workflows in a digital repository with links to publications and/or data, together with a copy of the software management plan (SMP) and README file(s). Metadata should remain accessible even when the software is no longer available.

        You should encourage the citation of software in papers, and seek to establish persistent links between data, code, publications, and people. The FORCE11 FAIR principles, which were originally developed for research data, can also be applied to software, e.g.

            Findable: assigned unique identifier; described with rich metadata; indexed in searchable resource
            Accessible: retrievable using standard, open, free protocols; metadata accessible even when software is no longer available
            Interoperable: formal, accessible, shared language for knowledge representation; qualified references to other metadata
            Reusable: clear and accessible license; detailed provenance; meet community standards

        Data harmonisation in the Social Sciences

        Data harmonization is an important part of statistical analysis. Harmonising data requires a lot of time and effort on the part of the researcher to review the documentation of various international studies and to understand the syntax used. To ease this burden, several European initiatives are working to offer solutions for data harmonisation.

        Introduction

        This course covers data protection in particular and ethics more generally. It will help you understand the basic principles of data protection and introduces techniques for implementing data protection in your research processes. Upon completing this course, you will know:

            what personal data are and how you can protect them
            what to consider when developing consent forms
            how to store your data securely

        Data Protection

        Considering aspects of data protection is crucial for your research, particularly if you are planning to share your research data. Protecting research data means protecting the rights of humans involved in the research process.

        

        
        Key elements

        As a responsible researcher, you should become familiar with:

            the legal requirements that need to be respected when sharing data
            securing informed consent 
            selecting appropriate anonymisation strategies
            securely storing and transferring data 

        Remember - data protection should start at the earliest stages of the research process!

        What are personal data?

        

        
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        The term personal data refers to any information that can be used to identify living (and sometimes even deceased) individuals. For example, their name or date of birth. Some personal information - such as a person’s origin, political opinion, religious beliefs, health, trade union membership, or sexual orientation - is classified as sensitive personal data. Bear in mind that information such as the number of children a person has or their shoe size could be used to reveal the identity of a study participant if the study sample size is small. Whenever you are handling personal and/or sensitive personal data as part of your research, you need to make sure it is protected. 

        If you aren’t sure whether your research involves collecting personal data, it is best to speak with someone in your ethics team or data protection office to get advice as early as possible so that you can build in the appropriate data protection measures.

        From the outset of your research project, try to include measures for data protection in each step. Below are some actions you should take when starting each new project. 

            Discuss whether you actually need to collect personal data to carry out your research.
            Consider collecting data anonymously if possible.
            Identify which personal data which will be included in your research.
            Include aspects of data protection in your data management plan (DMP).
            Create and use consent forms. Find more information on consent forms below.
            Find the appropriate anonymisation strategy for your research. You will find more information on anonymisation strategies below.
            Securely store, control access, and transfer your data.

        CESSDA provides some useful tips on adapting your DMP to cover data protection here. Data cleaning and anonymising data can be very costly. It is a good idea to use the data management planning process as a way to identify any anonymisation activities that will incur additional costs and to request these in your grant application. 
        Personal Data

        In April 2016 the European Union adopted its regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR became enforceable in May 2018.

        By collecting and/or handling personal data, researchers are thereby required to follow a number of principles including:

            Transparency - processing personal data “lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner”
            Data Minimization - data use shall be limited to the purpose of the respective research
            Accuracy - inaccurate data must be “erased or rectified without delay”
            Integrity and Confidentiality - data must be protected by appropriate security measures (technical and organizational)

        Find out more about how the EU GDPR affects processing of personal data here. 
        GDPR

        With its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union provides a legal framework for data protection inside the EU, as well as for the export of these data outside its borders.   

        As for the collection of personal data, the GDPR includes an exemption for research:

            if it concerns “the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes” (Art. 5.1 2016/679/EU); or
            if “the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes“ (Art. 6.1 2016/679/EU).

        See here for the full text of the GDPR in several European languages.

        Informed consent
        What is informed consent? Complete
        Sample consent forms

        If you collect personal data in your research, you are required to obtain informed consent for data collection, processing, sharing, and preservation. The CESSDA Expert Tour Guide on Data Management includes useful guidance on developing consent forms. Check out the sample forms they provide - like the one below - which can help you create your own consent forms. Remember to include a statement that will help to facilitate reuse. For example, the UK Data Service suggests adding a statement that informs participants that  any information that can identify them will be removed or changed before files are shared with other researchers or results are made public.

        For more information on ethical aspects of research including the creation of consent forms, check out this presentation by Libby Bishop, UK Data Service in the FOSTER portal. The UK Data Service provides very useful examples of model consent forms.

        Secure data storage - European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA)

        The EGA provides life scientists with a sustainable infrastructure for the storage, coordination and distribution of human sequencing and phenotypic data.
        Click the arrows to navigate through the content
        What?

        The European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) infrastructure was developed by Elixir in 2013 to provide secure storage, coordination and distribution of human sequencing and phenotypic data, and regulated access to datasets to protect personal data of patients. The service is run by the CRG and EMBL-EBI.

        Since human genome data are classified as personal data, access to them are highly regulated and decisions relating to access requests to EGA content are taken by a Data Access Committee. Furthermore, the use of BEACON technology allows the user to identify only those data sets of real interest without downloading all potentially interesting ones. This makes the access regulation system pragmatic and ensures personal data protection at the same time.

        MODULE 06: Open Licensing:


        This course helps you to find the best open license for your research outputs. 
        Introduction

        Licensing your research outputs is an important part of practicing Open Science. In this course, you will:

            know what licenses are, how they work, and how to apply them 
            understand how different types of licenses can affect research output reuse
            know how to select the appropriate license for your research 

        Why do you need apply a license?

        Licensing is an important aspect of practising Open Science. By applying licenses to your outputs, you remove any ambiguity over what others can - and can't - do with your work. 

        An open license, such as a Creative Commons license, consists of different elements that can be combined. Each element consists of a condition that needs to be followed by the re-user. The different combinations allow for great variation in the type of open license you apply: some being very open, others being very restrictive.
        Open licenses
        Licensing your work
        Do you have the right to license your work?

        According to the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), 'You have the right to apply a copyright licence to your data if you are its copyright owner. If your data is a compilation or derivative of others’ materials, your ability to license the data might be impeded by the rights under which you are using or incorporating the other material. That is why it is important to use or negotiate to use others’ materials under the least restrictive licence possible'. The ARDC has produced a helpful set of FAQs on data licensing that answer most of the common questions researchers have about sharing their outputs.  
        Variations in open licensing

        Re-use rights can vary greatly across the range of open licenses - some allow placing the work into the public domain while others introduce limitations on how it can be re-used. To embrace Open Science, you should aim to impose as few restrictions on reuse of your outputs as possible. It is important to remember that open licenses build on existing copyright. You cannot license materials that you do not own the rights to or that are not copyrightable in the first place. 
        Open licenses - more than just the content!

        Remember - it isn't just the content of your outputs that you need to consider but any special software needed to access and use the content. Wherever feasible, aim to use open software. 
        Licenses vs waivers

        If you are the owner, i.e. the holder of the intellectual property rights (IPR’s) of data or any other research output, you may choose to license your work enabling others “to do things that would otherwise infringe on the rights held“. Note that “[a] waiver, by contrast, is a legal instrument for giving up one’s rights to a resource, so that infringement becomes a non-issue“.


        For more information on the topic see: Ball, A. (2014). ‘How to License Research Data’. DCC How-to Guides. Edinburgh: Digital Curation Centre. Available online: http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides. 
        Licensing regulations

        The World Trade Organisation defines Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) as those "[...] rights given to persons over the creations of their minds. They usually give the creator an exclusive right over the use of his/her creation for a certain period of time". IPR primarily encompass copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Learning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) will help you understand the conditions of re-using other peoples' research/data. CESSDA ERIC provides an excellent overview on the topic in its user guide for data management (section on licensing research data). So, what do you need to consider in relation to IPR when undertaking your research? 
        Click the arrows to navigate through the content
        Who owns the IPR?

        As a researcher carrying out your work, you may be the owner of the related IPR for the outputs. But this is not guaranteed. Check your employment contract and/or Intellectual Property policies at your institution to see whether your employer holds the IPR rights associated with your outputs. In many cases, public institutions such as Universities are developing their own Open Science policies so sharing should not be a problem.

        How do licenses help …
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        Licensing your research/data will set the conditions for re-use. Licenses give you the opportunity to limit this re-use, e.g. by restricting commercial usage. When working on an externally funded research project, check your grant agreement for any licensing requirements. Bear in mind that allowing others to re-use your research/data will help you achieve greater publicity and impact from your work!

        Before deciding on the type of license to use, you should know that it is the structure of the database, and not the information contained, which is protected by intellectual property rights. It is also a good idea to make sure you are actually the rights holder for the database. Even if you collected the data (i.e. you are the creator) you may not be the rights holder. 

        When re-using other people‘s research/data, make sure to follow the rules set out by the license attached. For example, if the owner prohibits commercial use of their work/data, you would not be allowed to include their work in a derived database that charges users to access it. In some countries, it may even be prohibited to use it for training events with an associated participation fee.
        Finding the right license for your research
        This component is an accordion comprised of collapsible content panels containing display text. Select the item titles to toggle the visibility of these content panels.

        There are a number of resources and tools to help you find the right license for your research/data. Before considering the licensing options that are available for your works, you should first check whether you are obliged or strongly encouraged to use a certain licence as a condition of funding or deposit, or as a matter of local policy.

        Creative Commons is a non-profit organisation. It offers a number of different licenses that are freely usable. See below for more information on each of the six Creative Commons Licenses.

        Open Data Commons (ODC) offers different licenses that are freely usable including the Public Domain for data/databases license (PDDL); the Attribution for data/databases license (ODC-By); and the Attribution Share-Alike for data/databases license (ODC-ODbL).

        For example, FarmSubsidy.org is a database that contains information on the EU subsidy spending for farmers and is made available under the Open Database License. The ODC offers a helpful guide to making your data open.

        Creative Commons Licenses

        Creative Commons is a non-profit organisation that enables sharing and re-use of outputs through the provision of free legal tools. Below you can explore the features of the six Creative Commons licenses and two public domain tools available. A good overview of CC licenses for Open Science is provided by Creative Commons UK. The information below has been reproduced from the Creative Commons website. Note that for licensing no registration is necessary - neither for the copyright-holder nor for materials to be licensed. 

        You can make use of the Creative Commons license choosing tool to help you decide which is best for your research. You might also want to check out this detailed description of licenses that was produced by CESSDA ERIC.  
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials. See more on the features of this license.
        CC BY

        This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects. See more on the features of this license.
        CC BY-SA

        This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you. See more on the features of this license. 
        CC BY-ND

        This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms. See more on the features of this license. 
        CC BY-NC

        This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. See more on the features of this license. 
        CC BY-NC-SA

        This license is the most restrictive of the six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially. See more on the features of this license. 
        CC BY-NC-ND

        CC0 is a waiver rather than a license. It enables scientists, educators, artists and other creators and owners of copyright- or database-protected content to waive those interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and re-use the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law. This license places your outputs into the Public domain. Others are free to copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. See more about the features of this license. 
        CC0

        The Creative Commons Public Domain Mark (CC PDM) is a tool that allows users to assert that a work is already in the public domain. The motivation for the tool is to allow public domain works to be more easily discovered and recognised as such, but it should not be used for waiving rights.

        Title, Author, Source, License (TASL)

        When reusing data, you may need to provide attribution as a condition of the associated license. If a specified attribution is not provided, a good approach is to ensure you've captured the title, author, source, and license (TASL). When applying licences that require attribution to your own data, be sure to provide a suggested means of attribution that covers TASL as well. Explore each aspect of TASL below.

        Three steps to data licensing

        When licensing your research outputs remember to follow these three steps.
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        Not all data is copyrightable in all jurisdictions.  If the data is not copyrightable or if you are not sure, apply a CCO or other open data public domain dedication. This provides clarity for the reuser. 

        If you don’t own the rights, you need to comply with the requirements of the original rights holder.

        Determine what license you want to apply.

        Remember that any license imposing more conditions than attribution makes reuse, crawling, text and data mining either very complicated or simply impossible

        Consider applying CC0 or other open data public domain dedication. If you want to ensure you are correctly attributed, provide a clear statement in the credits. Attribution is a key element of scientific research, so in principle all reusers of your data will be keen to attribute you correctly.

        MODULE 07: Open Access Publishing:


        This course will help you become skilled in making your publications openly accessible in line with funder requirements and in the wider context of Open Science.
        Introduction

        This course helps you to become skilled in Open Access (OA) publishing in the context of Open Science. By the end of the course, you will:

            understand how to publish your work openly and be aware of the advantages
            be able to find an OA publisher for your research
            know how to find a suitable repository to provide OA and archive your work
            know how to publish OA monographs
            understand funders' expectations and policies on OA
            be able to secure funding for Article Processing Charges (APCs) where applicable

        Definition of OA

        "By 'open access’ to [research] literature we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.” [Budapest Open Access Initiative]

        Need a refresher on OA essentials and key terms? Check out these helpful resources:

            PASTEUR4OA Briefing Paper: Open Access
            Definitions of Terms Used in Open Science and Open Access

        

        OA improves the speed, efficiency and efficacy of research, reproducibility and collaborations. OA also increases the visibility, usage and impact of research and allows the professional, practitioner and business communities, and the interested public, to benefit from research.

        Get started with OA publishing by finding a suitable journal or a suitable repository for your publications.
        Finding an OA publisher

        Find a suitable OA journal for your discipline by searching the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).  DOAJ is a community-curated online directory that indexes over 11,000 high quality, OA, peer-reviewed journals. You can search DOAJ content using facets on the left-hand side of the website and next to search box: search by ISSN, subject, license, publisher, full text language, date added, DOI, author, title, keywords, and country.

        Good to know - over 70% of the journals listed by the DOAJ do not charge article processing charges (APCs)! Take a look at the list here. And researchers in any country can request a fee waiver if unable to pay. Read more on APCs in the end of this course. 

        If you aren't sure whether your previous research publications are accessible or not, tools such as Dissemin can help you search for copies of your papers in a large collection of open repositories and tells you which ones cannot be accessed.  
        DOAJ
        How can you tell if a publisher is reputable? Before you submit, evaluate your journal choice.

        There are hundreds of journals to choose from and it can be hard to determine which ones are reputable. It is a good idea to use the 'Think. Check. Submit' checklist to help you assess the quality of the journal you are considering. Only submit your article if you can answer ‘yes’ to most of the questions on the checklist. If you are still not sure about your choice, speak to your supervisor or manager about your publishing options. Librarians and colleagues who focus on scholarly communication issues in your field can also provide useful guidance and advice.

        Case study: an example of an OA journal publishing platform in the Humanities

        The Open Library of Humanities (OLH) is a non-profit OA publisher for the humanities. A more detailed overview of OLH is available here. 
        Click the arrows to navigate through the content
        What?

        Supported by core grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, OLH was founded in 2015 by academics. Providing a sustainable and safe platform, the OLH enables authors to publish OA without any author-facing charges. This is possible through a model of Library Partnerships Subsidies, meaning that libraries collectively fund the venue and its array of journals. In practice this means that the more libraries that band together, the lower the costs per article for each institution.
        Finding a suitable Open Access repository for your publications
        Self-archive your article in an OA repository

        Publish in the OA journal of your choice but be sure to self-archive your article with a suitable OA repository to make your publications more visible and to ensure that they are preserved over the longer term. It is a good idea to keep preprint and postprint versions of your articles. Preprints are all the versions of an academic article or other publication before it has been submitted for peer review, while the postprint is the form of the article after all the peer review changes are in place.

        With free tools - Unpaywall and/or OA Button - everybody can access a free copy of your pay-walled paper with just one click. 

        Full text aggregators of OA scientific content such as CORE and search engines such as BASE provide single search interfaces to help you find OA content.

        Not sure if your publisher allows self-archiving?

        Check the journal self-archiving policy on the publisher's web-site. If in doubt, check the self-archiving policy of your journal using publisher copyright policies &amp; self-archiving tool SHERPA RoMEO. This is a UK based service but it covers international journals. You can also try DULCINEA which summarises self-archiving policies of Spanish journals following SHERPA/ROMEO colours taxonomy and Héloïse which summarises self-archiving policies of French journals.

        Finding an institutional or discipline specific repository

        Many Universities and research performing organisations have set up their own institutional repositories to allow their researchers to deposit their publications. If you're not sure whether your institution has a repository, check with your Library. You can also search in OpenDOAR - an authoritative directory of academic OA repositories. The Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) also provides timely information about the growth and status of repositories throughout the world. 

        In some instances, you'll want to deposit your work with a discipline-specific repository. To find one, check out the OA Directory.

        ZENODO - an example of a general Open Access repository

        If you don't have access to an institutional or discipline-specific repository to self-archive your publications, you can upload them to Zenodo which was created by OpenAIRE and CERN to provide a place for researchers to make their outputs accessible for the longer-term.

        Zenodo in a nutshell:

            Accepts any kind of research output from across all disciplines. 
            Uploads are assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to make them easily discoverable and uniquely citeable.
            Users can create and curate their own community OA repository for a workshop, project, department, or journal.
            Research outputs are stored safely for the future in the same cloud infrastructure as CERN's own LHC research data.

        Zenodo
        Are social networking site like ResearchGate or Academia.edu repositories?

        Social networking sites can be great for boosting visibility of your work but they are not OA repositories. It is a better idea to self-archive your publication to an OA repository and then link to it from social networking sites. Take a look at the table below to see how social networking sites differ from an Open Access repository. More information. 
        What about books and monographs?
        Publish your monograph in OA

        Researchers in the arts, humanities and social sciences often publish their findings in books and monographs rather than journal articles. OA book and monograph publishing is gaining ground and there are an increasing number of options available to authors. What's more, books published as OA tend to have a larger readership than traditional books which is good news for authors! In fact, one study on scholarly publishing in the social sciences reported that book sales rose by 300% after monographs were made openly available online. So how can you go about getting your book published in Open Access?

        Case study: strengthening the OA movement in the humanities

        Open Humanities Press (OHP) is an international community of scholars, editors and readers with a focus on critical and cultural theory. The OHP acknowledges the crisis in humanities publishing and therefore acts towards solutions on the principles of access, scholarship, diversity and transparency. It is an independent volunteer initiative promoting OA scholarship in journals, books and exploring new forms of scholarly communication and has been in operation since 2006. The OHP Editorial Board participates in journal assessments, review and approve book series proposals, perform and manage peer review, and edit the OHP book series. 
        Case study: integrating OA monographs into the Open Science ecosystem

        OPERAS is a consortium of almost 40 partners from 15 countries. It is aimed at providing a pan-European infrastructure to rethink and reshape publishing, discovery and dissemination in the Social Sciences and Humanities. OPERAS’ unique approach is to unite researchers, libraries, publishers and infrastructure providers in a common effort, in order to diversify and improve scholarly communication and the publication landscape. Neither merging nor replacing, but nurturing existing realities, OPERAS provides innovative services to bring Social Sciences and Humanities into Open Science and the European Open Science Cloud.

        OPERAS is designed to elaborate effective and scalable long-term strategies for the future development of the digital infrastructure and community building needed to innovate scholarly communication. A first concrete and hands-on step is HIRMEOS (High Integration of Research Monographs in the European Open Science infrastructure), a EU-funded project that is affiliated to OPERAS and launched in 2017. The project is coordinated by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and involves nine partners from six European countries. HIRMEOS addresses the particularities of academic monographs as a specific support for scientific communication in the Social Sciences and Humanities and tackles the main obstacles to a full integration of monographs into the European Open Science Cloud. It aims at prototyping innovative services for monographs in support of Open Science infrastructure by providing additional data, persistent identifiers, links and interactions to the documents, and at the same time paving the way to new potential tools for research assessment, which is still a major challenge in the Humanities and Social Sciences.
        What do funding bodies expect you to do?

        Several research funders (Research Councils, Charities, Foundations) have introduced policies on OA to publications and data. The general expectation is that publicly funded research is a public good, and should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. 
        What does this mean in real terms?

        In general, most funding bodies expect any final, peer-reviewed manuscripts accepted for publication to be made openly available but it is always best to check your funder's specific policy for details. Check the SPARC Europe Analysis of Open Data and Open Science Policies in Europe to find out more. Many funders will consider reducing or withholding part of the grant if beneficiaries breach any of their OA obligations so it is always wise to check the policies provided on your funder's website to make sure you know exactly what they expect and when. 

        
        Will funders support costs relating to OA in grant applications?

        Yes! Most funding bodies will support justified costs relating to OA being requested in grant applications. In many cases, this will include Article Processing Charges (APCs).

        
        How to provide OA in Horizon 2020

        The European Commission has taken a big step towards open science in Europe. All projects receiving Horizon 2020 funding are required to make sure that any peer-reviewed journal article they publish is openly available. 

        Article 29.2 of the Model Grant Agreement sets out detailed legal requirements on OA to scientific publications: under Horizon 2020, each beneficiary must ensure OA to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to its results. The beneficiaries may opt for green or gold OA.

        Other types of scientific publications, such as non-peer-reviewed articles as well as monographs, books, conference proceedings and ‘grey literature’ (i.e. informally published material not having gone through a standard publishing process, e.g. reports), are not covered by the OA obligation.

        Good practice: However, to ensure fuller and wider access, beneficiaries are encouraged to provide OA also to these other types of scientific publications (where possible).

        (H2020 Programme AGA – Annotated Model Grant Agreement)

        Each beneficiary must deposit as soon as possible and at the latest on publication.

        OA must be ensured immediately or after an embargo period:

        GREEN – 6 - 12 months (for social sciences and humanities) depending on the research area

        GOLD – immediately

        Some journals require longer embargo periods (check SHERPA/RoMEO database and make sure that your journal's policy matches the H2020 requirements).
        This component is an accordion comprised of collapsible content panels containing display text. Select the item titles to toggle the visibility of these content panels.
        Here are some tips on things you should be doing with regards to OA at different stages of your project.
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        Create an outline dissemination and exploitation strategy in your proposal and include OA to help show how you will realise impact. Include details on how results be shared and be clear about any restrictions on access. 

        Be sure to consider the number of publications and the journals you might publish in so you can allocate sufficient resources for Article Processing Charges! Combine self-archiving (GREEN) and publishing in OA journals (GOLD) to achieve maximum of OA.

        Include specific provisions in the Consortium Agreement about where publications and data will be deposited and who is responsible for doing this. 

        Implement your dissemination strategy, report at reviews and provide updates. 

        Keep track of issues, discuss the solutions (publisher embargoes, repositories for specific material, etc.).

        Who will make sure that all outputs have been deposited in the appropriate repositories?

        If there are OA publications foreseen after the end of the project (i.e. which will not be covered by the budget) consider how any APCs will be paid for. Combine self-archiving (GREEN) and publishing in OA journals (GOLD) to achieve maximum of OA.

        
        Make it easy for funders to find your OA research publications (and for you to get credit for your work)!

        Make it easy for funding bodies to find your OA publications. When uploading your publications to an Open Access repository, be sure to include the following:

            the name and acronym of the related project(s)
            the grant number provided by your funder (this is usually mandatory)
            the publication date, and details of any embargo period if applicable
            a stable digital object identifier (DOI) which identifies the publication and links to an authoritative version and any related outputs (data, software)
            remember to add your ORCID identifier to unambiguously link this output back to you!

        There are services that can help you!

        OpenAIRE picks up your OA publications and links them to CORDIS and the Participants portal. OpenAIRE also links papers to projects and datasets. You can look up your project page on the OpenAIRE portal - it also includes a neat Appbox.

        Overview of APCs in three minutes

        This short video by Audiopedia introduces the concept of Article Processing Charges (APCs).
        Video Player
        00:00 | 00:00
        What are APCs?

        Earlier we learned that Article Processing Charges (APCs) are the most widely used commercial method for financing OA publishing. APCs are levied in two ways:

            Authors are charged to publish their work in a fully Open Access journal. This is known as Gold Open Access.
            Authors are charged to make their individual publications OA in an otherwise subscription based collection. This is known as the hybrid model.

        The PASTEUR4OA Briefing Paper: Introduction to Article Processing Charges offers a good overview. 

        APCs are not the only way to finance OA journals, though. There are other income models, from advertising and donations to sponsorships and subsidies. You can find more information on the income models for OA publishing in this report.
        What’s the average cost of APCs?

        It's not so easy to answer this question. A high percentage of OA journals does not charge APCs at all, for example over 70% of DOAJ journals do not charge APCs. And the values differ substantially for those journals that do charge APCs.

        APCs for hybrid OA have been higher ever since they appeared, comparing with fully OA journals.

        Björk &amp; Solomon (2014) estimated the average price of Article Processing Charges (APC) for established OA journals at ca. 1,020 EUR and for hybrid journals (subscription journal with OA option for individual articles) at ca. 1,980 EUR.

        More recently, the Open APC initiative, that releases datasets on fees paid for OA journal articles by universities and research institutions under an open database license on Github, estimates the average payment for fully OA journals at 1,484 EUR, whereas for hybrid journals the average fee is 2,492 EUR.

        Where to get funding for APCs?

        Many funding bodies allow you to request funds in new grant applications to support OA publishing. 

        For example, APCs are supported within Horizon 2020 grant applications. Researchers can choose to publish in either an OA or hybrid journals. You should bear in mind though that you can only request funding for the publications that will be submitted during the active stage of your project. Those that are submitted after the project ends and incur APCs will not eligible.

        APC waivers

        Also, there is great discrepancy between APC costs and most of the publishers are willing to offer waivers to authors from mid to low income countries (see DOAJ survey May 2014) or those in financial need. The applications for APC waivers are usually made at the point of manuscript submission and are considered on a case-by-case basis.

        MODULE 08: Sharing Preprints:


        This course introduces the practice of sharing preprints and helps you to see how it can support your research. 
        Introduction

        This course shows you how sharing preprints can improve your research and support Open Science. By the end of the course, you will:

            know what preprints are
            be able to find a suitable preprints platform to share your early findings
            understand the pro and cons of sharing preprints
            be aware of how sharing preprints can benefit your career progression

        This is a media player component. Select the play / pause button to watch or listen.
        What are preprints?

        Preprints are a way in which a manuscript containing scientific results can be rapidly communicated from one scientist, or a group of scientists, to the entire scientific community. This video by ASAPbio (Accelerating Science and Publication in biology) explains what preprints are and their benefits, how they differ from journal publications, and how scientists can use both mechanisms to communicate their work.

        Being the first gives you the initial recognition of the finding, even if the peer-reviewed publication is later than the competition. This diminishes the opportunity for unscrupulous referees to ‘sit’ on your paper while they rush to get their own version out.

        A preprint provides funding agencies and promotion and hiring committees with public evidence of your most recent accomplishments, which is pertinent for their decision-making.

        (ASAPbio Preprint FAQ: Why do people use preprints? What is their value?)

        Conference organizers and publishers often look for new and unpublished research in preprint servers. By adding your research, you may find you are invited to speak at relevant conferences or to submit your findings to journals. 

        You can send the link of your public preprint to fellow scientists and ask for comments. Sometimes scientists or even broader audience might contact you through email or through commentary on the server. These type of interactions and feedback can help you to improve your final journal publication beyond the two or three anonymous scientists who review your paper for a journal.

        (ASAPbio Preprint FAQ: Why do people use preprints? What is their value?)

        

        Preprints are the main mechanism for disseminating work and establishing priority in the physics, and we anticipate this developing in biology (see draft document from the recent ASAPbio meeting and an eLife article by Vale and Hyman).

        (ASAPbio Preprint FAQ: Why do people use preprints? What is their value?)

        Once your technique or results are in the public domain, new interactions can occur which can advance your work.

        (ASAPbio Preprint FAQ: Why do people use preprints? What is their value?)

        Your research is made available to all scientists without requirement of subscription or other journal-imposed pay wall.

        However, many journals are updating their policies because of the rising popularity of preprints.

        (Stein Aerts and Sara Aibar (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain &amp; Disease Research) (Who’s afraid of bioRxiv: Weighing the pros and cons of preprint publishing) 

        There is no regulation on checking ‘preprint data’ yet, so it’s not unthinkable that scientists rush to publish similar work after reading a publication in a preprint repository.

        (Stein Aerts and Sara Aibar (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain &amp; Disease Research) (Who’s afraid of bioRxiv: Weighing the pros and cons of preprint publishing) 

        If the press publishes results from a preprint server, this might hinder later publications in traditional journals.

        (Stein Aerts and Sara Aibar (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain &amp; Disease Research) (Who’s afraid of bioRxiv: Weighing the pros and cons of preprint publishing)

        Poor quality publications, irreproducibility, and scooping are already issues with our journal system, but there is no current evidence that the situation will worsen with preprints.  Most of these (with the exception of human research) have been tested with physics research and have not come to pass with arXiv; nor is there any indication that these problems are surfacing in biology preprints.  

        (ASAPbio Preprint FAQ: What are the main arguments against preprints or possible unintended consequences?)

        In practice, these tendencies are mitigated by the powerful driving force of scientists to develop and maintain a good reputation within the scientific community.  Reputation is the single most important factor for developing a sustained career in the sciences.  Even for scientists who voice the above concerns, when asked if they might be tempted to behave in such manners they immediately respond “no.” In fact, in some instances, poor quality/irreproducible work might be spotted by the community and corrected before reaching final publication in a journal.

        (ASAPbio Preprint FAQ: What are the main arguments against preprints or possible unintended consequences?)

        It can’t happen, since preprint postings are accepted as date-stamped priority claims. See the Q&amp;A on scooping by Paul Ginsparg, founder of arXiv.

        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        Revealing identities of author and reviewers increases transparency. Reviewers can be held accountable for their evaluations. This leads to a higher review (in terms of tone and quality) with less instances of reviewer bias as conflicts of interest can be identified by the participating community.
        CC-BY Remko Van Dokkum

        Traditional peer review takes a long time. In many cases, it can be almost a year between submission and final publication meaning that access to research findings are delayed substantially. Moving from individual peer reviewers to community review speeds up the process significantly by opening up the pool of reviewers able and willing to take on the review. 
        CC-BY-NC-ND Marina Perevezentseva

        Including the wider community instead of depending on just 1-2 reviewers provides a better opportunity to identify methodological flaws or other inconsistencies in the research. Initiatives such as For better science and Pubpeer support open discussion and constructive criticism about scientific papers. The number of papers listed by retractionwatch highlights the fact that the current peer review system is not always a guarantee of quality.
        CC BY NC ND Rich Renomeron

        Reviewers can have differing opinions about the papers they review. It can often be unclear as to why a paper is rejected by one reviewer and not by another. Open peer review supports improved consistency and reduces the chance of bias by ensuring that more reviewers' views for a given paper can be captured and compared. 
        CC-BY-SA Stiller Beobachter

        Making reviewers' questions about a given paper open along with the responses from authors provides valuable context about the methodologies employed and research processes. This is only possible if review reports are made accessible.

        Peer review takes time and effort. Current peer review which hides the identity of reviewers does not allow those carrying out reviews to get credit for their work. By publishing their review reports and assigning them a DOI makes them citable research outputs in their own right. Linking these back to you by including your ORCID ensures that you always have an up to date CV of all areas of your work.

        Those authors making use of preprint servers to get early feedback on their work may also benefit from having their work made more visible to potential publishers. In some cases, authors who have shared early results via preprint servers have been approached directly by journals interested in publishing their work.

        OPR is not a silver bullet

        OPR is not perfect and does not mean that all bias will be eradicated or that senior researchers will not retaliate if younger researchers criticise their work. It will however, make such occurrences more open and can lead in turn to reviewers' reputations being damaged when they act inappropriately.

        Emerging OPR models are constantly evolving and improvements are being made as lessons are learned.

        The following workflow diagram contrasts the general concept of open and blinded peer review.

        How it is done:

        The manuscript is fast-checked, and published on a network-based platform. Through a forum, others can leave commentaries.

        Incentives:

            ensures quality (deters from submitting low standard manuscripts)
            faster dissemination of unpublished findings
            credit for parts of the research workflow that were formerly unrecognized
            fosters scientific discussion and collaboration

        Examples of open peer/public commentary platforms include The Winnower, Copernicus Publications.

        How it is done:

        After publication the review process is opened to the community. Commentaries and evaluations are published alongside the paper.

        Incentives:

            more transparency
            quick dissemination of scientific results

        Examples of post-publication peer review include F1000Research, The Winnower, or ScienceOpen

        

        How it is done:

        An independent service separates review process from publishers. The authors can submit their peer-reviewed work to any journal and journals can approach authors with publishing offers.

        Incentives:

            structured &amp; quick process (1 review → several submissions)
            reputation metrics for reviewers
            evaluation becomes transparent &amp; reputable (through persistent IDs)

        What?

        Launched in 2013 by Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, BioRxiv is an online archive where Life Science researchers can post their findings prior to the official journal peer review and publication. When a scientist posts their manuscript on the server, readers can add feedback in the form of public comments. The comments are moderated to ensure they conform to the standards of normal professional discourse.  This process sets a precedent to improve the robustness of the peer review process by involving the wider community at an early stage under the guiding principles of reproducibility and transparency. Many life sciences journals have updated their policies to allow publication of articles that have previously been posted as preprints.

        Why?

        The peer review process for research articles has traditionally been closed meaning that the editors and authors are not known to each other and the feedback is not disclosed.  However, in the physical sciences, online preprint servers like ArXiv have long been used to open up research to feedback from the wider community.  In the life sciences this trend is now starting to drive changes in the peer review process.

        Open Science Elements

            Open Peer Review platform (identities of commentators and authors are known)
            Community driven

        What?

        Led by GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, OSCOSS is a Social Science project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) with the aim of increasing open communication in all steps of the publishing process. The OSCOSS project developed a collaborative working environment to open the publishing process.

        Why?

        With their project, the OSCOSS team aims to overcome communication gaps between different steps of the publication process in order to increase efficiency.

        The Open Science Element

        As the tools being used and combined in OSCOSS are web-based, the project contributes to the idea of fostering open access publication. "It will make journals more 'open' (in terms of reusability) that are open access already, and it has the potential to serve as an incentive for turning 'closed' journals into open access ones."

        What? 

        Launched in 2006 as a partnership between MLibrary and the University of Michigan Press, digitalculturebooks publishes papers and books from new media studies &amp; Digital Humanities. Papers are available online for free and digitalculturebooks provides the platform to add annotations. Alongside every book the readers can show annotations by other users.

        MODULE 10: Open Science and Innovation:



        This course will show you how Responsible Research and Innovation is supported and accelerated through Open Science. 
        Introduction

        This course helps you to understand open business models and responsible research and innovation (RRI) and illustrates how these can foster innovation. By the end of the course, you will:

            understand key concepts and values of open business models and responsible research and innovation
            know how to plan your innovation activities
            be able to use Creative Commons licenses in business
            understand new technology transfer policies with the ethos of Open Science
            learn how to get things to market faster

        Open innovation

        Open innovation is part of a broad family of concepts that often share the word “open” and the concept of “openness” and is based on the same basic ideas: by collaborating with others, by re-using (and by being allowed to re-use) the results of others and by allowing others to use and improve the results of our efforts, we all get better. See more in Thoughts on Open Innovation: Essays on Open Innovation from leading thinkers in the field.

        Planning using the Business Canvas Model (BMC)

        Consider making use of the business model canvas (BMC) to help you to plan your open innovation activities. The BMC offers a visual and collaborative approach to business modelling and helps you to assess the value proposition of your business as well as identifying the activities and resources needed to deliver that value. Paul Stacey provides useful open business model canvas with questions based on Business Model Canvas Poster designed by Business Model Foundry AG CC BY-SA 3.0.

        Some questions to consider: Are there any open movements that exist already that your open business could build upon and participate in? How does license choice affect the business and which Creative Commons license will you use? Beyond revenue and profits what social good is generated by this business?

        The Collaboration to Clarify the Costs of Curation (4C) project provided useful resources on the BMC which are presented below.

        Start with the question - which customers use the services offered by the organisation.

        In this example for a data centre there are two customer segments - customers who want to deposit their research data into the research data repository, and customers who want to access and use the deposited research data.

        Licensing: Why use Creative Commons (CC) licenses in business?

        As Paul Stacey puts it, Creative Commons (CC) licenses amplify the affordances of digital technology and provide an enhanced means for social production in the networked economy. CC licenses do this by:

            removing artificial scarcity constraints;
            removing barriers to access;
            enabling rapid distribution and use;
            allowing for customization, personalization, adaptation, translation, and localization;
            supporting mass participation: fellow creators, end users, customers, and partners can contribute their expertise, suggest improvements, add new features, make enhancements, create derivatives, and ensure currency;
            distributing production, and making it possible to produce work faster, generate work of greater breadth and depth, innovate, and increase quality; and
            creating materials that are part of a shared global commons from which resources can be extracted for local use and to which local resources can be contributed.

        The six economic benefits

        Fátima São Simão and Teresa Nobre (CC Portugal) explains how CC licenses can actually improve a company’s business model (Creative Commons Toolkit for Business - The Six Benefits Explained in Detail):

        
        Click the plus sign to expand the text box

        By using the available CC licensed works, you can significantly reduce the investment your company needs to do when launching a new product or service in the market.

        By reusing CC licensed works, made available by a generous community of authors, you can produce effective materials without making huge investments. This can apply to many situations like product design and communication or even product development (namely, if you work in the creative sector).

        (Creative Commons Toolkit for Business - The Six Benefits Explained in Detail)

        Standardized contracts are one means of reducing transaction costs and legal uncertainty often associated with copyright licensing.

        CC licenses can be an effective means to help you reduce the costs of the transactions which would otherwise be necessary every time you would want to use and reuse a certain text, music, image or video in your business activity.

        (Creative Commons Toolkit for Business - The Six Benefits Explained in Detail)

        Using CC licenses on the content you produce and making it available to your target audience which can be an interesting way of doing market testing before you actually release the final product, allowing you to improve it while maximising your future benefits and often reducing your innovation and marketing costs.

        By doing so, you are allowing your potential clients (and partners) to actually try your product beforehand and give you feedback about it. This open innovation process is an excellent way to catch the attention of those early adopters that can actually influence the market you have targeted. On the other hand, by releasing and allowing them to reuse and re-adapt your product you can engage them in your product development process and make them as enthusiastic about it as you are. Because, after all, they've become partners of a collaborative innovation process. And you might have just found the international R&amp;D+I team you could have never afforded!

        Make good use of that collaboration and ask them to not only send you feedback but also write reviews that you can publish in your promotional materials. If the product succeeds, they will probably be happy to share that success with their circles. This is the best marketing you could ever wish for!

        (Creative Commons Toolkit for Business - The Six Benefits Explained in Detail)

        By licensing your own works under CC, you will be not only accelerating your access to the market and, thus, increasing your chances to gain an interesting market share, but also raising awareness by adopting a more sustainable attitude and building a following which can continue to be used and expanded on an ongoing basis, not just at the front end.

        If your product is really innovative this might mean you will have established a first mover advantage. This means that while your competitors are still thinking of ways to copy your product, you will already be in a comfortable position to continue innovating and eventually making it ever more difficult for them to catch up with you.

        On the other hand, by adopting CC licenses, you make sure that your work circulates more freely and thus becomes more accessible to your potential clients. This, of course, implies that you have developed an interesting business model around it.

        (Creative Commons Toolkit for Business - The Six Benefits Explained in Detail)

        You've probably heard about “opportunity costs” which mean that whenever you make a choice there is a cost for not having taken the benefit of your second best choice.

        When you use a CC license in a product, you will face an opportunity cost but you will also increase your chances to enjoy an opportunity benefit (i.e., the benefits you will have for not having decided otherwise). This means that by making your product available for others to reuse, re-adapt and share you might be surprised by unexpected returns you would have otherwise never even guess, namely, the opportunity to find partners around the world that will invite you to develop other exciting projects.

        Some of the CC licenses open up the possibility of forming a collaborative, distributed innovation network that can include fellow creators, end users, customers and partners who make improvements to the actual design or functionality of your product which can become integrated and core to its use going forward or can extend the core product in some way through add-ons.

        Besides, when you mark a work with a CC license, you are also building a reputation: you are showing the public that you are broadly interested in collaboration and interaction — even outside the context of the CC license. 

        (Creative Commons Toolkit for Business - The Six Benefits Explained in Detail)

        The use of CC licenses or CC licensed work in projects sends a message to the public that your company is socially responsible and is working towards generating revenue but also in making sure that everyone can improve and benefit from the work that you have been developing in many different ways.

        The use of CC licenses, by placing your company in a network of collaborative clients, partners and suppliers, allows it to keep a light structure, reducing costs by only using the resources that are really essential to your business. You are also making sure that others get the chance to develop new business models, create new products and services and generate new jobs and revenue streams.

        The use of CC licenses in businesses is a way to promote a network of sustainable open SMEs as opposed to a market run by closed large corporations which, by creating global monopolies based on artificial scarcity, tend to leave so many users, workers and entrepreneurs aside.

        Academia-industry: Redefining the role that IP plays in R&amp;D

        Looking for new approaches to the organisation of research and development (R&amp;D) and new technology transfer policies with the ethos of Open Science? Let's have a look at pharmaceutical R&amp;D as a case study. A New Pharmaceutical Commons: Transforming Drug Discovery policy paper argues that Open Science approaches represent the most promising path forward by addressing both scientific and organisational bottlenecks. The paper concludes by presenting a series of recommendations that would nurture and grow the Open Science component of the drug discovery ecosystem, potentially transforming how the medical challenges of this century are tackled in a way that is beneficial to patients and producers alike.

        New approaches to the organisation of pharmaceutical R&amp;D

        The traditional model for the discovery and development of new medicines is predicated on secrecy and the maximum use of IP rights. Today’s situation requires bold new approaches to the organisation of pharmaceutical R&amp;D. In particular, it calls for infusing drug discovery with the ethos of Open Science through adoption of a less restrictive approach to the sharing of pharmaceutical tools and data, and redefinition of the role that IP plays in the drug discovery process. Recent experimentation of varied open models by organisations around the world suggests that a radical reconstruction of the drug discovery ecosystem is not only urgently needed but also possible.

        Speeding up the process of developing new treatments and cutting the costs

        The NTD Drug Discovery Booster project aims to speed up the process and cut the cost of finding new treatments for Leishmaniasis and Chagas Disease, which 450 million people are at risk of contracting worldwide. This video explains how the Drug Discovery Booster uses a multilateral, simultaneous and iterative search process to speed up the screening for potential treatments. With this approach, the project will significantly shorten the time it will take to find new treatment leads.

        Recommendations for research institutions

            encourage the shift towards Open Science.
            avoid IP-centric measures of performance in the evaluation of technology transfer offices (TTOs).
            enhance the role of TTOs as brokers of multi-party, multi-stakeholder collaborations.
            adopt responsible licensing by university TTOs, which is meant to facilitate access to innovation in cases of pressing global need. 
            bring the Open Science ethos into the classroom by extending these principles to the training of postgraduate students. This is an opportunity to train a new generation of researchers in the ethos of open R&amp;D.

        Institutional case study: Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute (Neuro)

        Seeking to accelerate research advances and reimagine its role in the community, the Montreal Neurological Institute (Neuro) announced in the spring of 2016 that it would be launching a five-year experiment during which it would adopt Open Science — open data, open materials, and no patenting — across the institution. Neuro’s Open Science initiative plans to attract new private partners and to draw companies to the Montreal region, where the Neuro is based, leading to the creation of a local knowledge hub. It is the first institution to adopt an Open Science model across the entire spectrum of its research. (Gold ER (2016) Accelerating Translational Research through Open Science: The Neuro Experiment. PLoS Biol 14(12))
        Click the arrows to navigate through the content
        What?

        In adopting Open Science at the institutional level, the Neuro hopes to achieve benefits beyond that for research; the initiative provides a foundation for multiple parties—researchers in and outside of McGill University, patient organizations, regulators, and industry—to engage in neurobiological research and to engage in local “knowledge-based economic development”. These benefits are expected to extend beyond the institution itself into the wider community. Open Science provides advantages over proprietary models of innovation in this respect by enhancing partnerships, lowering transaction costs, and encouraging local innovation where the subject matter of the innovation contains significant degrees of “sticky” (knowledge that is less expensive to use in place than to move elsewhere), including tacit, knowledge.

        Industry case study: DOCKER

        Docker is the company behind an Open Source container platform for developers. They use an innovative business model making their basic tool free and open while still generating revenue. Container technology is used by researchers in the life sciences to run new studies or replicate existing ones. 
        Click the arrows to navigate through the content
        What?

        Docker is one of the most successful Open Source projects ever. The project is hosted on GitHub and has a core code base of more than 1400 contributors worldwide, of which only 30% are actually Docker employees. The basic tool is free under an Apache 2 license, one of the most popular licenses for code. This allows anyone to use, modify and redistribute the code in any context including closed and commercial projects. The collaborative and Open Source nature of the development of the software means the community can constantly share and build on the existing technology.  This also creates a critical mass of users of the free software, who may eventually desire additional commercial options and value-added features. Docker uses an open innovation business model which can generate and sustain profits by selling commercial services for their software like training, technical support, and additional products.

    These courses have been developed reusing openly available content produced by a range of content providers including DataOne, Research Data Netherlands, Open Data Institute, European Data Portal, Digital Curation Centre, UK Data Service, CESSDA ERIC, DARIAH, ELIXIR, Software Sustainability Institute, FOSTER and many others actively developing open educational resources relating to Open Science.

    The courses are presented in a similar style to that employed by the Open Data Institute (ODI) and the European Data Portal in the hopes that this will enable our content to augment the body of Open Science related materials already produced and make their collective reuse more seamless. To this end, we have also made use of the Adapt authoring tool also used by the ODI and European Data Portal.

    We have employed a variation of the case study approach developed by the European Commission's Open Science Monitor to help illustrate useful tools and initiatives from disciplinary perspectives.
